doing over the next twenty five minutes .\nB : so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager .\nB : do you want to introduce yourself again ?\nA : hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer .\nD : and i'm andrew and i'm our marketing expert .\nC : i'm craig and i'm user interface .\nB : so we're designing new remote control and have to record who's here actually .\nB : so that's david , andrew and craig , isn't it ?\nB : and you all arrived on time .\nB : so des design new remote control .\nB : as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly .\nB : so that's our our brief , as it were .\nB : and so there are three different stages to the design .\nB : i'm not really what what you have already received in your emails .\nB : what did you get ?\nA : got the project announcement about what the project is .\nA : designing remote control .\nA : that's about it , didn't get anything else .\nD : that's that's it .\nB : is that what everybody got ?\nA : did you get the same thing ?\nB : so we're gonna have like individual work and then meeting about it .\nB : and repeat that process three times .\nB : and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there .\nB : so you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it .\nB : so who would like to go first ?\nD : so this one here , ?\nD : my favourite animal is like beagle .\nD : charac favourite characteristics of it ?\nD : , high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take lot of physical affection from their family .\nD : and , that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health .\nD : so this is blue .\nD : my family's beagle .\nC : my favourite animal would be monkey .\nC : then they're small cute and furry , and when planet of the apes becomes real , i'm gonna be up there with them .\nA : there's too much gear .\nB : you can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss .\nB : we do we do .\nB : don't feel like you're in rush , anyway .\nD : coulda told you whole lot more about beagles .\nB : ach why not we might have to get you up again then .\nD : boy , let me tell you .\nB : what mine is .\nB : i'm gonna have to think on the spot now .\nB : is that whale ?\nA : anyway , , it's just the first animal think off the top of my head .\nA : big reason is 'cause i'm allergic to most animals .\nA : allergic to animal fur , so fish was natural choice .\nA : , and like whales .\nA : they come in and go eat everything in sight .\nA : and they're quite harmless and mild and interesting .\nB : still what i'm gonna write about .\nD : superb sketch , by the way .\nA : tail's bit big , .\nB : was gonna choose dog as .\nB : but i'll just draw different dog .\nB : my favourite animal is my own dog at home .\nB : that doesn't really look like him , actually .\nB : he looks more like pig , actually .\nD : see dog in there .\nB : that's very good of you .\nD : now see rooster .\nD : what kind is it ?\nB : he's mixture of various things .\nB : and what do like about him , that's just to suggest that his tail wags .\nB : he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very affectionate and and he's quite quite wee as so he can doesn't take up too much space .\nB : and and he does funny thing where he chases his tail as , which is quite amusing , so it is .\nD : is he aware that it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?\nB : he only does it after he's had his dinner and he'll just all of sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .\nA : it's an after dinner dog then .\nD : probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .\nB : where did you find this ?\nB : just down here ?\nB : what are we doing next ?\nB : we now need to discuss the project finance .\nB : so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro .\nB : so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale .\nB : and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .\nD : can we just go over that again ?\nD : so bas at twel alright , .\nD : so cost like production cost is twelve fifty , but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ?\nD : like on the shelf .\nB : imagine that's good question .\nD : our sale our sale anyway .\nB : imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want .\nB : but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ?\nD : away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones .\nB : regions and , .\nD : frequencies as as characters , different keypad styles and symbols .\nB : for remote control , do you think that will be suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .\nA : it does make sense from the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons .\nA : so , possibly .\nD : and then and then al the other thing international is on top of the price .\nD : i'm thinking the price might might appeal to certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so just chara just characteristic of the just or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five euro remote control might be big hit in london , might not be such big hit in greece , who knows , something like that , .\nB : what , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?\nB : like how much money people have to spend on things like ?\nB : aye , see what you mean , .\nB : good marketing thoughts .\nB : gosh , should be writing all this down .\nD : away i'm making some assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard .\nD : so i'm wondering away , is selling twenty five euros , is that the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or .\nB : like how much does , , remote control cost .\nB : twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds , isn't it ?\nB : or no , is it as much as that ?\nB : sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .\nD : i'd say so , .\nB : , i've never bought remote control , so how how good remote control that would get you .\nB : but , suppose it has to look and gimmicky .\nB : let me just scoot on ahead here .\nB : does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue ?\nD : do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other .\nB : thin no , actually .\nB : that would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .\nD : interesting thing about discussing production of remote control for me is that as you point out , don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .\nD : it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes .\nD : it just comes along .\nB : five minutes to end of meeting .\nB : we're bit behind .\nD : like so like how do you one one way of looking at it would be , the people producing television sets , they have to buy remote controls .\nD : or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want better one .\nC : know my parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .\nC : so for them it was just how many devices control .\nD : so , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses so .\nB : so do you think that should be like main design aim of our remote control , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ?\nD : like , what we could use is like example of successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots .\nD : they're gone from being just like little scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda .\nD : so , like , wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or , .\nB : or even like , , notes about what you wanna watch .\nB : like you might put in there want to watch such and such and look that's good idea .\nB : so extra functionalities .\nD : like , personally for me , at home i've i've combined the the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player .\nD : so they all work actually function together but have different remote controls for each of them .\nD : so it's ironic that that then they're in there , the sound and everything it's just one system .\nD : but each one's got its own little part .\nB : i'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes .\nB : i'll just check we've nothing else .\nB : so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one ?\nA : and you keep losing them .\nB : you keep losing them .\nA : finding them is really pain , .\nA : it's usually quite small , or when you want it , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table .\nB : you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make really high pitched noise they beep .\nD : that's just really good id .\nB : there is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?\nD : remember when the first remote control my my family had was on cable .\nD : actually had cable between it and the t_v_ and big like buttons that like , like on blender .\nD : and , , when about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still , , like massive junky thing on the table .\nB : still feels quite primitive .\nD : we could think about how , could be more , , streamlined .\nB : like touch screen ?\nD : something like that , .\nD : or whatever would be technologically reasonable .\nB : that's up to our industrial designer .\nD : 'cause it could it could it could be that it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having , these days there's pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , .\nB : it looks better .\nD : nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway .\nB : so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes .\nB : so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch .\nB : so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there .\nB : for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do .\nB : and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , .\nB : so it's the functional design stage is next , .\nB : and and that's the end of the meeting .\nB : so got that little message lot sooner than would , so .\nD : before we wrap up , just to make we're all on the same page here , , do we we were given an example of coffee machine , ?\nD : are we at ma now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ?\nD : or are we keeping like design commitment to television features ?\nB : just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now .\nB : that's up to us , you probably want some unique selling point of it , so , .\nA : one factor would be production cost .\nA : because there's cap there , so depends on how much you can cram into that price .\nA : that that's the maor .\nB : , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then .\nB : so , all for coming ."], ["<t> The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote. </t>  <t>

to start the meeting ?\nB : we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design .\nD : could you plug me in ?\nB : all ready to go ?\nB : so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .\nB : so just to to recap on what we did last time .\nB : got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is .\nB : nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control .\nB : they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else .\nB : the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .\nB : so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ .\nB : and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .\nB : i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is .\nB : it might be yellow , because there seems to be lot of yellow everywhere .\nD : and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?\nB : that's the thing , i'm i'm not because on the the company website , what does it say something , do they is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long .\nD : 'bout putting the fashion in electronics .\nB : or , just the idea , but i'm not .\nB : so that's something we can discuss as .\nB : so those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the t_v_ , and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company .\nB : so is everybody with any of that , or do you want me to recap ?\nA : nope , we're all set .\nB : time for presentations then .\nB : who would like to go first ?\nC : i'll go first .\nC : alright , can st steal this from the back of your laptop ?\nC : so this is the technical functions design .\nB : go on ahead .\nC : to do the the design have i've had look online , i've had look at the homepage , which has given us some insp inspiration from previous products .\nC : i've had look at the previous products to see what they offer and would like to ask you for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting .\nC : unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so , having look at the existing products , found out that it tends to come in two extremes , there's either very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you what you're doing .\nC : in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad .\nC : there's an example i'll show you at the end , sh show you now .\nC : here the button there and there .\nC : this one's prog .\nC : that one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does .\nC : not if you had look at the other control in that example .\nC : it's very simple one .\nC : it's got only the basic functions but it's the same size as the the hard to use one .\nC : it looked bit clunky .\nC : they're very big and not very much use for buttons .\nC : and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions .\nC : there's there's nothing for slow motion button .\nC : my own preferences , prefer the the clunky one .\nC : it's very easy to use .\nC : but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which quite like having on the controls .\nC : so believe the the advanced functions should be hidden in drawer , like tha from the bottom of it .\nC : so , now i'd like to ask for your preferences .\nC : not of how long we've got , , the clunky one is the one on the .\nB : can chat away for for five minutes or so at at most .\nB : just couple of minutes anyway .\nD : like lot of lot of what i've read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what craig's just gone over .\nD : so in part could could give you some of my personal preferences but could also add some to this which is just about market research .\nD : but anyway , we might come to that later .\nB : shall we sh 'll stick to your area for now .\nA : which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. .\nD : clunky in what sense , like heavier ?\nC : it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons .\nC : it's , , it's very spread out and , get the idea it'd be about this size .\nD : see , so it's more just basic .\nC : got very few buttons on it and , do we have any functions that we'd want on it ?\nB : it's valid point .\nB : like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing .\nB : so see see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , , what it does , so you get lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , that's good idea .\nB : it's good idea .\nC : so far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down .\nC : they're just the the very basics you could use for t_v_ .\nB : and then actual numbers for channels as , .\nC : you say that's required one or requested one ?\nD : which was that ?\nC : would you like the channels like the the numbers on thing , , .\nD : up the numbers , or the up down ?\nB : wou would say that's required , there's no way anybody's gonna buy remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , would anybody disagree with that ?\nB : what else , so don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about v_c_r_ , any like display controls do you think we need to worry about , like brightness and contrast ?\nD : es essentially what we're doing now is we're categorising .\nD : we're saying want this to be product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ?\nD : is that what we're we're doing ?\nD : we're like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ?\nC : to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible .\nB : are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ?\nB : do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this .\nB : so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and .\nC : there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .\nD : one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go .\nD : and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .\nD : if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely .\nD : they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory .\nD : so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip .\nD : and others that are also available and then others that are concealed .\nD : something like that .\nB : just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have lost no .\nB : do you think that's the only essential requirements , and then just things that would be if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , like mute button , that thing .\nB : any of you anything to add to that ?\nA : i'll add it later , the presentation .\nB : if we can move on to next presentation then .\nB : do you wanna probably not , actually .\nC : do you want to switch places ?\nD : can this can this pl reach ?\nD : can this plug come across ?\nD : so why don't pick up and move then .\nD : here , i'll just why don't er , can you go up behind me ?\nC : just just switch them .\nD : kinda this is so this i'm all in knot now .\nB : it'd be if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ?\nD : so say already , whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be lot of redundancy in the in the the issues and the the the things .\nB : like overlap between what you said ?\nB : for all that that'll happen .\nD : which is ma not necessarily bad thing , but may what i've already started doing is cr created slide in in my presentation here so so that we think what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly have hard time separating separating things completely .\nD : what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts lot on what like market research that that i've been so how do how do get this up ?\nB : hard to where your role ends , .\nB : pr , press function and eight , .\nA : function , the blue button .\nA : next to the control on the left .\nA : you have to push it together .\nD : that that's doing it now .\nA : try that again .\nC : think the the wire in the back might be loose .\nB : you wanna here we go .\nA : there we go .\nB : there you go .\nD : just before bring this up what i'll just say is what i've what i've done is tried to collect some information so that then relay this to to you so that it's now becomes collective thing .\nD : and then lead us in the direction of deciding , what what are our options , what should we decide and do what , so .\nA : increase that 'cause we can't see the that's much better .\nB : can you , .\nA : there you go .\nD : that would be .\nD : so does that make sense ?\nD : so what got is looked into some information and tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what decisions we could take away from it and then by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities .\nD : 'cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through .\nD : so i'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and , what they want and what are issues with with existing products .\nD : to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics .\nD : and then , as say we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and dunno .\nA : bouncing on top .\nD : so this is what i've found here , lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together .\nD : users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls .\nD : so they find them ugly .\nD : most people find them ugly .\nD : the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .\nD : i'm gonna we'll look at that in second .\nD : most people use only very slim portion of all the controls .\nD : so what we're looking at here is people want this technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them .\nD : so what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different inspirations , , one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy .\nD : and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands .\nD : they get lost lot , as it came up in our last meeting .\nD : takes time to learn how to use them .\nD : this is why mention when craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so it doesn't just look like big panel , kinda like when you you look at , , new computer keyboard , that is quite explanatory .\nD : if you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those .\nD : and will admit what r_s_i_ stands for .\nB : repetitive strain injury .\nA : is installing new remote control something that people , it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people .\nD : no , that did not come up .\nD : so here here is another review here of the main things .\nD : also found that most people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition .\nD : now we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control .\nD : so if that's possible we might consider getting into it .\nD : and here as we move thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy .\nD : people additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the the techie features how we can put that into unit which is which people like .\nD : they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .\nB : so want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities .\nD : so just looking at what what craig craig's ideas are sorta tell me that what we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include in this .\nD : so if we do say want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology .\nD : it's like like find lot of t_v_s these days , something really like about is if you wanna just turn on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through .\nB : so it you wanna group all the different types of functions together , .\nB : that's it's good idea .\nD : that's that's the but i'm my hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say , how do we collectively move on with it .\nD : haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that .\nD : but not let that confine us technologically .\nD : any comments on all of that ?\nB : one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be who's our our target audience , our target market .\nB : so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ?\nB : who wou who would have the money to spend .\nD : where's the money , .\nB : if if like twenty five euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , don't i'm not really how much that will retail at .\nD : and who watches t_v_ .\nB : but you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one .\nB : so , who do you think we're aiming this at ?\nA : 'cause twenty five euros for remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?\nB : it's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , .\nA : is that too is that lot of money to buy an extra remote or replacement remote ?\nA : so not the high end range , but middle , middle up-ish .\nA : you pay , what , ten ten quid for remote ?\nA : like simple replacement , .\nA : if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ?\nD : this this kinda touches on your comments there , david .\nD : these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is table of what people would pay more for certain feature .\nD : just gives us rough idea of where the the will to spend money on t_v_ equipment is .\nD : mostly focused around the twenty five age group .\nB : so do you think we're we're aiming at fairly young market then ?\nD : young professional , .\nD : , it's the .\nC : did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ?\nB : do you think then voice recognition is something we should really consider ?\nB : what what do you think , craig ?\nC : the the older group .\nD : it does it does fit with the market that we're identifying , in terms of .\nB : we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause , there needs to be some selling point to it .\nB : so anybody anything there to add just young professionals , like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like really high response to that .\nB : so we could say that was our target .\nA : twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as group as because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .\nB : so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young .\nB : they have bit of expendable income to spend on this thing .\nA : perhaps that age group is significant as because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work .\nA : people who are about wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on computer or mobile phone like that .\nA : so these are people who are gadgety , ?\nA : people who are growing up used to , in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would regular .\nB : so they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech .\nB : that that's that's good point .\nB : so so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition if we can .\nD : if we can .\nA : one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition now , because , based on what you've go everybody's saying , , you want something simple .\nB : why is that ?\nA : you want basic and you want something that's easy to use .\nA : speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .\nD : could it be an on off thing ?\nA : but what i'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into particular technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .\nD : like if you want it on .\nB : where you can activate it and deactivate it ?\nA : so we should suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's it's something that can be used to fulfil function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .\nB : do you wanna give us your presentation and then then we can might have been good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're , exactly , .\nD : it's good t's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind .\nB : it's something that's just occurred to me as if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people with physical disability as .\nD : and not losing .\nD : and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , they they're saying it's lose it in the couch .\nD : like we're what we're getting in into here is mating different design features together that they .\nC : reckon one problem with speech recognition is i've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours .\nD : really , you've seen one before .\nB : do you think we need like further advances in that area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?\nC : it'd probably quite expensive to put in .\nA : do you mind passing me my notepad .\nB : there you go .\nA : this is just the working design .\nA : this is just what how would go about it .\nA : try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done .\nA : in practical way , we it is .\nA : we've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like besides the basics , back in the back of our minds we the basics are .\nA : has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , , which one of the basics are you trying to target .\nA : are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ?\nA : and the idea is just to get everybody to usually have have have design that's there as basic , so , , things that to start everything going .\nA : but everybody does have some idea , so don't think there's need for that .\nA : this finding things is little bit confusing , so i'll go into the diagram first .\nA : it just explains how the process goes through , from from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need in the diagram and in this slide probably works better .\nA : you need some power source .\nA : battery , to keep it going .\nA : and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last .\nA : it ties you down perhaps bit later on in terms of the technologies how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want .\nA : like , voice recognition , .\nA : that might be constrained because that you might need to power microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there .\nA : the basic thing is there's user interface where people punch button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever .\nA : and that picks up an input from user , logic series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to , based on you push button , so will do something with button .\nA : so button is the power button , .\nA : and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here .\nA : and that's about it in terms of my design .\nA : it's fairly general , and the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , like voice recognition , , , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having thing that we don't have enough power .\nA : so it's not really constraint in that sense , but these are functionally , , the base , what the technology has to do .\nA : so the rest of it we should you you wanna go back to what the functions are ?\nA : that's more relevant to discussion ?\nB : do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ?\nB : are you are you all done ?\nA : more or less .\nA : ps , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing .\nA : you have transmitter , an input device , logic chip , , like that .\nA : this would be .\nD : and like on the means since we're on the topic of the technology , are there any like what are our options ?\nD : alright , what's what in is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin .\nA : these these aren't technology options in that sense .\nA : this is just basic principles and basic components that are needed .\nD : the basic principle of .\nA : if you needed if you needed to add voice recognition , , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , , which you have microphone , the v_r_ and like that .\nB : so this just show how we're modularising the whole thing .\nA : so each component represents one function , but the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , , and the power are things that you won't have to care about .\nA : and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it .\nA : there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the t_v_ .\nA : are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ?\nA : because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to .\nB : ll worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would it would effect how long how long it took us to get this to market , so suspect it might be good idea just to restrict our our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about how we transmit it because it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha , .\nA : there might be one other problem with the transmission , in particular now , since we're talking about voice recognition .\nA : if somebody's gonna talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .\nA : it you may not require that , but , it's it's it's something very natural , , , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push button to start talking about it .\nA : then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight say the t_v_'s at that chair , and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .\nA : so in that sense , there's not really restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process .\nA : not so much further down .\nD : and just clarification before we finish this .\nD : does is our controller is it have the option of being on standard frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ?\nA : there's there's not much specific specific information , but that one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices .\nA : because infra-red is something which everybody has .\nB : ll we've in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t_v_ , so that's what we should do for now .\nD : just to t_v_ , .\nB : something was wondering about was the power .\nB : is it worth considering like having like charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ?\nB : is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?\nA : there's there's , from from from component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component .\nA : you need docking cradle , , for you to put it in to charge .\nA : or you need to get the user to plug it in .\nA : and most users are very use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .\nA : but unless the controller's gonna consume lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries month , then don't think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about .\nB : so just stick to to regular .\nB : so the i'm just gonna just recap what said at the start , was that the the whole point of this meeting was to finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do .\nB : so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?\nB : and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do .\nB : do you wanna recap on that , craig ?\nC : we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic possible .\nC : on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to channel .\nD : and is it going to include any of the the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ?\nC : we include mute , but apart from that we just we'll go for the simpleness .\nA : another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ?\nD : is it is it is it is it not an option still that we include some things just as under like under door or some 'cause what what i'm i'd be bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , , they get ours and it's doesn't have that .\nB : it's as optional functions .\nD : if that'd be problem .\nA : could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories .\nA : one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be device .\nA : this may not map very to advanced functionality especially , but that from manufacturer's point of view , from person designing the device , but from point of view of person using the device , t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off .\nA : like so what we could have is like three buckets , , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .\nA : it might help with the visualisation .\nA : and it would actually help with the component build as .\nB : gotta got five minutes to wrap up now .\nB : next thing we're doing is having lunch .\nB : and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage .\nB : so i'll be putting the minutes of this this meeting into the project documents folder .\nB : so just to just to confirm that we we're doing in the next the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , for our industrial designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept .\nB : user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching .\nB : and you'll all get specific instructions as .\nB : so , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking .\nB : do you wanna start with david .\nB : anything else to say ?\nA : no , not really .\nD : just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of clarity and when we when we resume that we'll use this idea david's proposed , where we think of these three buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is , , we're talking about this .\nB : that's definitely good idea .\nD : shall we do that , then ?\nC : just about the three buckets , what would go in the the device functions one ?\nA : things like on off .\nA : because they don't have anything to do with what you see .\nA : me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , , so and channel .\nD : and and channel .\nA : because the on off also goes , , like on off like power , not on off sound .\nA : not on off video .\nA : although you don't turn off the video on your t_v_ , but you might wanna turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's mute button , , so you you have you have choice of putting it on to others or device .\nA : device is anything which we can't categorise , .\nB : so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like your bass settings and actual volume hi .\nA : we put it out .\nA : anything to do with what you hear , .\nA : you you put that into audio .\nB : and then visual , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things , like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , like that .\nA : and then video is anything that you can see .\nD : and then suppose quite likely what would happen is in the device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are bit more .\nA : like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there .\nA : even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind .\nA : it's easy to use , that's one thing that and from the component point of view it's easy to build as 'cause things are like fixed .\nB : so , just things to think about are like the fact it's gotta look good , because of who we're we're , , targeting this at .\nB : something quirky in design .\nB : make it ergonomic to hold , , things like that .\nB : so that's it .\nB : that's the meeting over .\nD : then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us ."], ["<t> The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert discussed his

make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background .\nD : everything have is kinda background .\nB : we all ready to go ?\nB : how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting .\nB : and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , .\nB : and told you about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan .\nB : so that was the last meeting .\nB : is there anything have forgotten anything ?\nB : is that everything ?\nB : so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to that you're gonna want to discuss , just make note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end .\nB : that might be better idea this time .\nB : and so if we start off with andrew and then craig and then david , if that's alright .\nB : and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about , .\nB : so if you wanna take this .\nD : why don't get that ?\nB : screwed in quite tightly .\nB : what did how did we leave it with speech recognition now ?\nB : we did we say we were gonna try incorporate it but we hadn't made definite decision on that ?\nB : should also point out that the the final objective of this meeting is to reach decision on the concepts of the product .\nB : so that's the end result hopefully .\nD : alright so is it function eight ?\nB : hopefully appear in wee second .\nB : up there we go .\nD : so let me just start this .\nD : so move on .\nD : where'd it all go ?\nD : it's not good .\nD : lemme just see where find it .\nD : this looks more like it .\nD : opened up the template .\nD : alright so let's have look here .\nD : so this was the method that i've taken .\nB : here we go .\nD : what wanna do here , before we get into it too far , is want to show you all the background information have that we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .\nD : and and then sorta go through some of the way that i've dealt with that information , and then bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .\nD : so i've tried to take whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify trends that are are in sync and are important to our our project plan that we have so far , and then initiate discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other other elements of the of the project .\nD : does that make sense , tha that strategy ?\nD : that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why suggested we get in this .\nB : aye fair point definitely .\nD : so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general , consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that the br television remote control , fancy look and feel , , and not , it specified , not functional look or or feel , fancy .\nD : however , this is where we kinda have to be very , , creative about it .\nD : number two was that it be innovative .\nD : so that tells me that we have to find way to be innovative without adding just unnecessary functional bits to it .\nD : and third priority for ease of use , so again that gives us general picture of how it has to be , quite user friendly while still having technology .\nD : so it i'll just say away as bit of foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of marketing , is that what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .\nD : like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up , what , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because the thing that the message here is ease of use .\nD : so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ?\nD : that's where we're gonna go with this .\nD : then there's the other aspect of the back the the market research have here is on fashion style , , which as we've is priority .\nD : top european fashion trend that read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , , especially in clothes and furniture .\nD : and when first saw that , do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get into it , or we completely steer away from it , do what ?\nD : so my my feeling is that we do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .\nD : 'cause what we're in what we're in is partly home decor , partly something like computer , so we might wanna be careful about how how quickly we create like remote control in the shape of an apple , that would be pushing it .\nD : and then in terms of material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case .\nD : so probably lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , that'll be in our favour .\nD : so these this is the summary of everything .\nD : style is number one thing in the in the market of who we're selling to .\nD : innovative design technology's also must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be cutting edge , but ease of use has to be insured throughout .\nD : that was like the number three thing .\nD : and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours that's the way interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i've written at written at the bottom to give us context of discussion , mac ipods , something which is , i'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons .\nD : what mac ipod is ?\nB : that's true , .\nD : i'm thinking however mac ipod is last year's because it's very hard and glassy and glossy , so i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of mac ipod and we're then making it more of like more of like comfortable type of or more of like more vibrant to friendly thing to have .\nD : and then so this is with all that information what i'm what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more techni like production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout .\nD : like like we think of some thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , sorta like marketing identity .\nD : does that make sense ?\nD : so so like threw out few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause i'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .\nD : like the ones the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like theme to it would be like like lemon like that , something which is , like you see lot in in other areas .\nD : like see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and so anyway it's just just an idea .\nD : i'm thinking we could incorporate some of these features into fairly into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like like something to do with like lighting within it .\nD : like just within the simple sense , when you pick up phone and touch button it lights up , usually the buttons light up .\nD : how can we build on that ?\nD : like it could light up in different colours or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers so .\nD : anyway those are that's all have , but hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into .\nB : craig do you wanna plug yours in then ?\nC : is it working ?\nD : did you press eight ?\nA : it's probably not sending .\nB : something coming now , .\nA : there it is .\nB : there we go .\nC : and so think of this concept .\nC : to research it i've had look on the the homepage again .\nC : it's provided me with more examples of previously existing remote controls .\nC : there's wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , so i've taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this so then this we're looking for suggestions on size size of control and the buttons , the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .\nC : what found from the research is that most the current controls are just big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .\nC : they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're hold like big bricks , and they're very easily lost .\nC : they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them .\nC : the the controls themselves tend to use very inconsistent colour scheme .\nC : the stand-by button isn't always red , it really should be .\nC : it's something the user then identify with .\nC : this is red switch off , that's how it should be .\nC : i'm not if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for .\nC : there's problem that i've i've got couple of preferences for the the end control get with the the red colour button for stand-by and the other examples of that the buttons should be large .\nC : they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones .\nC : they should be easy to press , very comfortable .\nC : one of the examples given on the homepage was there's an up and down volume button but both of them have v_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be down volume button , that's kinda confusing .\nC : should avoid things like that .\nC : if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .\nC : trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .\nD : do we have corporate colour scheme ?\nB : it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after .\nA : and the play-doh 's yellow .\nC : any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be hidden , they shouldn't be on the shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some special extra effort .\nC : if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , they got cold or we should definitely avoid the big square block look .\nC : that's just wrong .\nC : and we got an email from it's the the research department , and they've said the voice control can now talk back if you ask it question .\nC : so it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take and possibility .\nB : aye that's good idea , .\nC : and these are problems i've had with it .\nC : where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is .\nC : it's , fashion into electronics .\nC : and we how flexible the colour scheme is .\nC : you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say if we can use any other colours or that's it .\nD : lots of good information there .\nB : that that was very good , and now with david .\nD : it's shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , ?\nB : t'd be handy , wouldn't it .\nD : just it takes second , doesn't it ?\nB : do do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this .\nA : let me just get this going first .\nA : there it is .\nA : that should be it .\nA : the same thing again , started with something very basic .\nA : so just so you have some idea of what's involved in my process , and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch depending on what your needs are .\nA : the components are exactly the same .\nA : like what you said , the most input that's needed is in the user interface .\nA : the rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity .\nA : like you said time to market was problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost .\nA : and the power is factor of that .\nA : and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , and that would have some inte impact on how more how you hold rather than the actual use using the the remote control because like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .\nA : so it's just matter of working out space .\nA : so three things , cost , complexity , and the size .\nA : these are the three things that will have an impact on you .\nA : so just go through it in the components .\nA : these are the options that are available to you , i'm not very about the voice thing 'cause got another email and it was quite sketchy on what the voice options are .\nA : it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen .\nA : it said something about sensor but never clarified that .\nA : so if you could see the other email that they sent you , 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa so your basic components are buttons , and you have wheel available , like mouse scroll wheel , there's an display , these are quite standard things .\nD : they're standard , aren't they ?\nA : no they're the sense that these are all the options available for you .\nA : i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again bit later .\nA : then there's how the case actually looks .\nA : it can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , don't think you can use them in combination , but could check back for you , but don't think you can actually use them in combination .\nB : we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?\nA : plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , wasn't i'm not very about the titanium .\nA : they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .\nA : the rubber was restriction on the power source you could use , but the titanium had different things on the shape of the thing , so that there is some restriction on you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but it might be easier from cost perspective and complexity just to use one .\nA : as opposed to two .\nA : and the other components are logic chips , again i'll i'll go back to the component chips .\nA : the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit and that impacts cost .\nA : don't think the logic chip has issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size .\nA : power consumption should be about the same .\nA : the main impact is complexity , and the other thing is the power options .\nA : the first one is standard battery .\nA : the second one is more of gimmick then actually useable thing , it's wind-up , crank .\nB : i'll clear one of these things for you .\nB : just by moving it .\nA : but that that might be something that's more of look and feel decision because don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources .\nA : whatever it is you still need battery 'cause don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing .\nA : the other ones are solar powered cell , which may not be idea in europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead .\nA : so like what said , you probably need like battery and something else .\nA : and the kinetic one for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's sales gimmick .\nA : from marketing gimmick it it's technology thing , it's shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it .\nA : you have you had those balls , those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , that might be gimmick combined with rubber .\nA : just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , just so .\nA : my from my role , don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , something comfortable to hold , small and slim that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , like phone , too small phone .\nA : and the other thing is from production point of view the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit .\nA : and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it so .\nA : let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions .\nA : the user interface restrictions means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard , the panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic .\nA : the case with rubber case you can't have the solar panels .\nA : with the titanium case , let me just check that , titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square .\nA : there's no restriction on the plastic , and it can't be curved on the wood .\nD : it can't be curved .\nA : so that's again , don't think you can use them in combination , especially the titanium suspect they're very fixed to particular need .\nA : so mixing them may not be good idea .\nB : can it's just i'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but you ask away .\nD : question on can ask question ?\nD : can we power light in this ?\nD : can we get strong enough battery to power light ?\nA : we could because the panel requires power , and the is form of light so that are you thinking are you thinking of of light in the sense of light light , or light in the sense of it glows frankenstein , it's alive .\nD : so one of the things we can just try and include is really good battery .\nB : why what light do you want are you thinking of ?\nD : i'm thinking it might be that for this to be high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that realistic goal one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ?\nD : illuminate the buttons .\nD : i'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching d_v_d_ and you you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that's what everybody does .\nD : where's the volume button in the dark , and you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up .\nB : like phone , like the backlight in phone .\nD : like phone , .\nD : whereas with phones , people charge them once week .\nD : we're gonna need to put in really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days .\nA : that's why the option of the the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like watch , like an automatic watch it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it .\nD : but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ?\nA : so you could trigger that to light , like said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , , and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness .\nB : let's just go back to the marketing ideas for start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most .\nB : so so just to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product .\nB : so back to your idea about incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that .\nB : what does everybody think about does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ?\nB : that's the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ?\nC : we could go for like not fruit shape but very curvy type shape .\nC : you could have the same texture and colour as fruit .\nB : so do are we thinking something that like could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you you'd hold onto comfortably or so something quite curvy ?\nC : probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand .\nB : colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much .\nA : he made that .\nB : and when the corporate colour is yellow , we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow .\nB : and then the the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ?\nD : i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that unifies lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are our number one marketing motive is the look and feel .\nD : so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize .\nD : what we could do is think about concept which touches back to the on the the colour , you said company colour yellow .\nD : if we think of something , like was saying also lime and lemon , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series .\nD : we just come up with something like that we use it as theme to inspire the shapes and things .\nA : is there particular shape that you're interested in ?\nA : like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ?\nA : does it need with square thing wha 'cause that will help narrow down the choice of like fruit .\nB : like in circular in shape or choice of material .\nB : 'cause was kinda thinking about as how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch .\nA : i'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky .\nC : see i'm i'd quite like snowman type shape .\nB : it feels bit more comfortable , and we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it .\nB : and then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and we might be moving away from that so 'm do we really want it in like the shape of lemon or no don't think we do either .\nD : no no no not .\nD : it's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with .\nB : so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing .\nC : so larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .\nB : that's quite distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it .\nB : so should we go with that ?\nD : can we like to and wha like do you have can you like just we can visualize it .\nB : do you wanna draw it on the board ?\nC : something like that you got two groups there it could fold up and you get third group inside or you have volume controls about there .\nB : that'd be good .\nB : so call it the snowman-shape trademark .\nB : and colour-wise what does everybody think ?\nB : it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere .\nB : do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something .\nC : so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons .\nB : and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ?\nB : the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , .\nB : or when you like or if you turn it off if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere .\nC : that might scare me .\nB : any thoughts on that ?\nC : that'd probably scare me .\nC : you turn it on your control possessed .\nB : unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ?\nB : would we put that on the inside or it's bound to increase the cost of it lot , would've thought .\nA : do we need an display ?\nA : what what's the functionality of that ?\nA : but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ?\nD : what would it achieve ?\nA : putting in lights is cheap but putting in an panel just to make it glow is bit of .\nD : l_c_ 'd when you used to mention the i'd wonder what that would be about .\nD : and the the thing could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings .\nD : so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can it actually tells you what it is .\nA : that will be problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so it's bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday .\nB : so so no need for an display ?\nA : i'm not saying there's no need for an display , but it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the tends to be an output as as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?\nB : that would make it very complex .\nA : we have the option of the speaker as the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there need for the remote control to to talk back ?\nB : if there is really , no would say no need for talk-back .\nA : you could put game on it .\nB : does anybody disagree with that ?\nA : when the t_v_ dies you can play with the remote control .\nB : so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , do you wanna group them into head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ?\nC : the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside .\nC : the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere .\nB : what else do you need to talk about ?\nA : where would you physically position the buttons ?\nA : that that has some impact on on on many things .\nA : you wanna draw onto the .\nB : so i'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause have slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about .\nB : sh we've got five minutes back we go .\nB : energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ?\nB : really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , what does anybody think about that ?\nD : i've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches , , , .\nA : no , like said we have hybrid thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just .\nD : support for it .\nD : just it's just worth pointing out because like i've i've known i've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery .\nD : i've also known people to have things like like jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of nuisance because don't wear it all the time .\nD : like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down .\nD : so we should think about .\nB : suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either .\nB : so you'd have the battery as the to keep it ticking over idea i'm really we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as .\nB : so that's what energy is referring to here .\nB : chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it david ?\nB : as for the case , discussed that know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel .\nD : and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small .\nD : just lot of the one of the things running through my mind now , realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .\nD : should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly theme like what is it that we're we're using to to achieve those goals ?\nD : like so so backlighting , that would be good .\nB : could have things like backlighting the buttons and like that .\nA : or even clear case .\nA : glowing glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , but in the dark it , it's alive .\nD : clear , that'd be .\nB : aye that would be good idea .\nA : in in slight subtle way .\nB : so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can see through it .\nD : that'd be really good .\nB : is that what you mean ?\nA : or or there might be light running through it like mouse .\nA : you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power .\nA : so the power the battery in that sense , you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that but because the case is transparent so it gives it little bit of glow , doesn't make it freaky .\nD : they they emanate light through it .\nD : and then the other thing that we we're we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so i'm thinking should we try and think about having something like some an innovative concept about how the the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will wanna do .\nD : could we use like jog dial , like just round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?\nA : the question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ?\nA : do you want to roll it like that ?\nA : do you want to roll it like that ?\nA : 'cause in mouse your hand's in position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .\nB : if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ?\nD : why don't we do it like mouse then ?\nB : if you're holding it in your hand you could do you think ?\nA : that's very unnatural motion to .\nA : can you imagine you have to scroll lot .\nA : it might work for volume , and some of the brightness controls and like that , but not for channels .\nA : if you have telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to .\nA : and don't think having that too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the .\nC : but then for for skipping large amount of channels you do have to to skip the channel button , the number part .\nA : but users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of .\nD : but that's not bad thing is it ?\nB : just wouldn't it we do need to make decision on whether we want to incorporate jog dial in and quickly .\nD : because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button .\nD : jog dials are much easier than that .\nD : you just roll .\nB : i'm all for them actually , they're quite very quick to to use .\nB : so does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design ?\nB : and the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ?\nD : like if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small .\nB : we really gotta wrap up so .\nD : it's small , and that we've got like the the slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that isn't that what we just said said we just have to decide now ?\nB : we can do that , .\nB : let's let's try and get the slogan on there , and .\nD : and then like jo and then like jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like like here , in with the it would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand .\nA : so you wanna expand the shape of the that that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you're left handed or you're handed you might be locking yourself in .\nD : or just fit it in like down the middle here .\nA : could could jump in and suggest something quickly ?\nB : i'm gonna have to i'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time .\nB : is there anything anybody's unsure about ?\nB : just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , know that the designers are gonna be working with play-doh on that .\nB : so that'll be that'll be good .\nB : and i'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible .\nB : anything you think we haven't discussed that we need to ?\nB : is everybody happy about what they're gonna be doing ?\nD : the jog dial , it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be .\nA : one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite big impact on the thing that's what was thinking the slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand .\nA : incorporating logo is quite straight forward .\nA : there's lots of space for it but it's also marketing and function .\nB : that's design thing that you can can discuss , .\nD : , and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard .\nB : to make something flush with the case ?\nD : something bit more flush , , or have rubber incorporated into the case as , so that it has and also plastic i've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .\nB : sp kinda grippy ?\nA : feel like fruit .\nD : they feel like , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , they're actually just plastic that's textured , little bit like .\nA : kinda like that .\nB : i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to call this to close 'cause we're way over time .\nB : so that's really good , like we've had much to talk about that run out of time to do so .\nB : so off you go and design wooh .\nB : quite jealous actually .\nA : you got to choose first .\nA : no , we're kidding .\nA : can swipe your power cable , don't matters .\nA : lemme , i'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left .\nA : this is real hassle and .\nA : i'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy take them off again ."], ["<t> The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed

: we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product .\nB : and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .\nB : so just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have snowman shaped remote control with no display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , hopefully jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as .\nB : anything i've missed ?\nB : so if you want to present your prototype go ahead .\nD : this is it ?\nA : ninja homer , made in japan .\nD : there are few changes we've made .\nD : look at the expense sheet , and it turned to be quite lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and inside , so instead we've this is gonna be an screen , just very very basic one , very small with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and confirm button .\nD : apart from that , it's just the same as we discussed last time .\nA : and there isn't it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ?\nA : so the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that they're not in use .\nC : where are they ?\nA : they're in the panel and the jog-dial ?\nA : 'cause the panel just displays functionally what you're doing .\nB : so what thing is gonna be .\nA : if you're using an advanced function , like brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say it's like it only has four columns , it's very simple like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast .\nA : it might even be one , bit more complex panel with pictures like the sun or the , , the the symbols of the various functions .\nC : and what is this here ?\nA : that's number pad .\nC : so the number pad is , .\nB : where are we gonna have the slogan ?\nA : they're al along this .\nD : just like inside there .\nA : you have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as , or at the bottom .\nA : 'cause slogans are usually quite small , , they're not like huge so they're say button's about say button's about this size , , so you would still have plenty of space for slogan , say even for that .\nB : so if this isn't to scale , what dimensions are you thinking about here ?\nD : want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with finger so we reckon that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .\nA : so that would be about centimetre for button , so one two three four centimetres .\nA : plus half five six seven eight , about nine total .\nC : about nine in total .\nB : six , seven , eight , nine , ten .\nB : so we're talking about ten centimetres .\nC : that sounds good .\nB : that would be good .\nB : so ten centimetres in height .\nA : nine , ten .\nC : that'd be good , pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be that sounds like really good size , if you see it there .\nB : that's and it's very bright as .\nC : is it possible i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours .\nC : is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ?\nD : 'm we're gonna have again the the the foggy yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .\nD : but this button , because it's red it's very prominent , we're gonna use it as it can be the power button if you hold it for two seconds it'll send stand-by signal .\nB : so just could you just list all the things that it does so write them in the report .\nD : apart from that it's gonna be used as confirm button for the screen and you use this as jog-dial .\nB : so that's like an button , .\nA : we've discussed how high it is , but how wide is it ?\nC : how high is it ?\nA : no as in the height , but what about the width ?\nD : didn't put five centimetres .\nB : like depth of the actual thing .\nA : do we need five ?\nA : don't think five is be about three and half .\nD : something by there .\nB : is this to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there .\nB : so you can power on and off , what else can you do ?\nC : three and half .\nD : you can skip straight to channel using these buttons .\nD : were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the the and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume .\nB : jog-dial for volume .\nB : and what else do you do with the jog-dial ?\nD : you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour and .\nB : contrast , brightness , , and anything else ?\nD : just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we didn't actually go through and specify the what can t_v_ do ?\nB : of the designers what are they ?\nA : things like brightness , contrast , tuning the channels .\nB : that's good one .\nA : the various inputs .\nA : are you having v_c_r_ , are you having which input do you have ?\nC : probably colour or sharpness .\nA : colour , sharpness .\nA : lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them .\nB : what about sound settings ?\nB : can you change any of those ?\nA : audio , we have like your basic your base , your mid-range , your high range .\nD : the the balance .\nA : left-right balance , even pre-programmed sound modes , like the user could determine like series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be when you click on that then it would go to that setting .\nB : is there anything else it can do ?\nB : that 'cause that's that's fine .\nB : just need to know so write it down .\nB : that's it , so we can now we can now have little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything .\nB : so for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?\nB : do we have kinetic as ?\nA : we need an .\nB : and that's because of cost restraints is it ?\nB : what about the electronics here ?\nA : we need an advanced chip , .\nA : let me just confirm that .\nB : the case , what does it mean by single and double , do ?\nD : single would just be one oval whereas double is this thing .\nB : so we want double-curved ?\nB : is there any rubber in the buttons or any , and we wanted special colours didn't we ?\nA : we're gonna have to skip the rubber .\nB : so i'll have to put that no we ho how many colours have we got there ?\nA : for the case itself , one colour .\nA : it's one special colour .\nB : just one colour , .\nA : 'cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .\nB : so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?\nA : one and the l_c_ display .\nB : and then buttons , we have what , two colours ?\nA : how many we've got push buttons as .\nD : we have got some push buttons as .\nC : or even clear .\nB : like so push button and integrated scroll wheel push .\nD : so reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber .\nD : i'm not if that counts but you can see we're we're all very far beyond the could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .\nA : let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .\nA : and special colour for the buttons , so four again .\nB : so why are we arriving at the number four ?\nB : where does the number four come from ?\nA : 'cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .\nB : so we're writing down four .\nA : so we're just estimating that it would be less .\nB : how about these ?\nB : are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic ?\nB : so we're quite far over .\nB : now we're gonna something's gonna have to go .\nB : we're at sixteen point eight and something has to go to the tune of two point three euro , so let me see , what are we yes , four point three .\nC : how how are we going to achieve this high-end product if we only have very sparse two point three ?\nC : four point three no ?\nB : my maths is all out .\nC : and then where is the .\nA : how much would that save us ?\nB : how much would that save us ?\nA : that will only save you one .\nD : that is one .\nA : the other thing could be that you could take away the panel and the advanced chip together , because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as , so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond , which is technically doable thing so .\nD : that's fair enough , .\nB : so so what's our reviewed suggestion ?\nB : take away the l_c_ display ?\nA : and the advanced chip goes away as .\nB : to be replaced with regular chip .\nA : so what that means is that the twelve buttons that you see there .\nB : and so we've got point three to get rid of .\nB : and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ?\nD : that's one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so so reckon reckon that probably counts as special form for the buttons .\nA : functionally you're gonna have to intercept so four is good estimate for , so you can't actually cut it's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .\nB : do you think ?\nB : like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ?\nA : it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is single panel .\nB : have point three to get rid of somewhere .\nA : we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away colours for for the buttons .\nB : no can do .\nC : we could just go with .\nA : normal coloured buttons .\nB : do you want colour differentiation here ?\nA : no that's not the button we're talking about .\nA : that's the buttons only refer to the pad so should we take that off ?\nA : it's back to the original .\nA : so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost .\nB : ach that's shame .\nB : so take away that completely ?\nB : and now we're under budget .\nB : so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted .\nB : doesn't say so .\nC : how about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ?\nB : that's good idea .\nB : does that mean that one button has special form or .\nD : there's just one button so handy .\nB : ll there we go .\nB : so i'm just gonna have to redraw this now .\nB : so we're not gonna have the anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on on the t_v_ it'll show you what you're doing , which is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here .\nC : was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?\nA : what do you mean by profile ?\nC : flat as possible .\nD : you see envision it as being quite deep deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .\nC : that's what was thinking , to , .\nA : we didn't have enough play-doh to make it three d_ .\nC : al fair enough .\nC : just thought i'd ask .\nA : so there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height .\nB : so just to to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres ?\nB : and then so height-wise how how tall do you envisage it being ?\nB : about that big ?\nD : it works , .\nB : about two centimetres , .\nC : two's not very high though .\nA : this is about this is about two .\nA : slightly more than two , so .\nD : see , about that thick .\nC : closer to three even or two and half .\nB : ach , that is .\nB : we'll we'll say two point five .\nB : so we have it within cost anyway .\nB : so project evaluation is this point .\nB : so can we close that ?\nB : this is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be .\nB : someone is gonna have to that's fine that's fine .\nC : it's probably just if it's worth getting into , but just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think little bit more out of the box in terms of button grid , because i've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it stylized or in different concept that that .\nA : that's something that's very hard to catch , so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .\nA : the the look and the colour is something which is , but that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then because when you put it on the shelf button shape might be good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , 'cause positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone pad .\nC : what about button shape ?\nB : so at this point we , let me see , discuss how satisfied we all are with with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the we had around us .\nB : let me see wasn't really what that was , go for that first .\nC : do you want me to do you want me to do my design evaluation last ?\nA : we should do the design evaluation first .\nB : wasn't entirely what who was supposed to be doing that , but you go for it .\nC : alright so the way this works , i'm gonna need to plug into powerpoint , i'll try and do it as quick as possible .\nC : this is i'll just go over your head if that's .\nA : don't think you need the power , so no , that's that's .\nC : don't need the powerpoint ?\nA : no , the power cord itself .\nC : course , that's true .\nA : so then you have bit more freedom to you you still have your blue fingers .\nC : let me get that .\nC : so what this is is set-up for us to use like the idea is that i've set up i've reviewed all of the the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as criteria of evaluation for the for the current design or the plan , and so we can review that .\nA : you killed monster .\nC : it's gonna end up being elementary because we're sort we're in we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but doesn't seem like it's going , does it ?\nB : there it is .\nC : and i'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be way for us to go through and decide if we're review where we stand with it .\nC : so so to bring together two things , design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , .\nC : so these these are the and we've been asked to to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just work on consensus system so we just come to an agreement .\nC : so the first one , stylish look and feel .\nA : rate that pretty highly .\nB : compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good .\nC : me my only reservation with it was that we went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and if yellow's gonna really be hit .\nB : what does anybody else think ?\nC : but what do you think ?\nD : i'm seeing five then .\nB : would say five or six .\nA : i'm fine with that .\nC : let's go with five then .\nC : fi just actually the opposite .\nA : it's one to seven , ?\nC : the so it meant three , .\nB : yes then , then would say two or three .\nA : what's the scale , one to seven , ?\nD : one's high-ish isn't it ?\nC : one is high .\nD : so , two or three .\nC : let's go with two point five then .\nC : control high tech innovation .\nB : has the wee jog-dial but .\nC : we had to remove , so we've had to remove few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial 's good .\nB : i'd go with three or four , three .\nA : say it's more medium , but going towards little bit higher than medium thing .\nB : about three , .\nC : style reflects fruit inspired colour , design .\nC : shouldn't have said colour , but just sorta .\nB : that's but the yellow , it could be lemon yellow colour , couldn't it ?\nA : the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , except for the the the red button , they because for want of , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else .\nC : so we'll go two .\nC : and design is simple to use , simple in features .\nB : it's really basic looking isn't it ?\nC : fairly basic , you think ?\nB : i'd give that nearly one .\nC : soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?\nC : we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite bit of compromise for price .\nD : it's about five .\nB : that's really low .\nD : we have to use plastic so it's probably gonna be i'd probably increase the cost .\nC : that's could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ?\nC : was that an option ?\nA : it'll be cost prohibitive , .\nD : we've only got like what , ten cents left so .\nC : it would cost more than plastic .\nC : logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?\nB : gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there ?\nC : and it's within budget , .\nC : it is , isn't it ?\nC : so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ?\nB : out of forty nine , .\nC : out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .\nC : we are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .\nB : 's pretty good .\nC : so it's pretty good .\nC : translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal .\nC : 'cause if you turn that into hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it's , about seventy , seventy percent .\nB : twice that , about thirty one .\nB : so ab about sixty nine , seventy percent .\nB : it's pretty good .\nC : that was just little formality for us to go through .\nC : hundred pound pen .\nB : nobody saw it , honestly .\nA : the cameras did .\nB : is that you all have all finished , or .\nC : that's that's me .\nC : did have one other one other frame , not knowing how we would deal with this information , in theory this process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .\nC : it's not something need to push through , but should we thinking more about the dimensions , like more of three dimensional shapes as as opposed to just that flat could our design involve series of colours so that it's more of like line where we have like the , like the harvest line or the vibrant , the whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon .\nC : it's just discussion .\nC : we can just abandon this , it's fine .\nC : i'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do .\nB : are you submitting the the evaluation criteria or am ?\nB : what your instructions have been .\nC : to record it and haven't been asked to submit it yet .\nB : just wondering if need to include it in the minutes , because if you're submitting it anyway then .\nA : it keeps getting too big .\nB : next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .\nA : i'm i'm listening i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so i'm playing with the play-doh as .\nA : just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the play-doh ?\nA : just about l_e_g_o_ lego .\nB : do you wanna just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , , forgotten that .\nB : you got different , they're good aren't they , .\nC : like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that .\nC : it's really quick .\nB : here we are .\nB : as note we'll do this alphabetically .\nB : do you wanna start andrew ?\nC : so what is it you're asking of me now ?\nB : just your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them .\nC : or our work on setting this up .\nC : is it i'll just go through your system then .\nC : the the room is fairly institutional , but the main thing is , our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to have cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , , as in other words this this room is centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just debating , but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we put out our ideas and then , .\nB : do you feel though that that you were able to have quite lot of creative input into the thing ?\nB : but don't don't means the room as in this room .\nB : it means like .\nC : , room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room .\nC : no , , .\nB : dunno do you it means it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so .\nC : on dif answering the question in those terms i'd say that actually there's tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then then we're told use the co company company colours .\nC : so what do we do .\nC : we're told terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like formality then an actual within the constraints the .\nA : you feel like you're caged within whatever it's like balloon in cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side .\nA : the constraints do come in very fast .\nB : do what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , .\nB : so still on the topic of room for creativity next up is craig .\nD : agree with his point it's it is quite lot of fun to go and then you have hit the end then go , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .\nA : another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also very strong factor , and structure .\nA : because for brainstorming meeting you want structure thows you to allows ideas to get tossed , to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .\nA : and that point about the room not being very friendly to that , that's very big thing , and the fact that we're wearing these things restricts feel it 'cause wear my glasses , , and that but that irritates me it it it does actually affect how , whether you feel comfortable to communicate .\nA : feel like i'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and .\nB : so you think more relaxed atmosphere would be more conducive to creative thought or , but actual environment ?\nA : not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear that creates boundaries to that and and the time the time given also restricts excuse me .\nB : what about leadership ?\nB : if that means like , if did good job .\nB : don't really know .\nC : ll my sense on that is what guidance and direction , encouragement from and you as , just acting as team leader .\nB : from like your personal coach person and like that , do you think ?\nC : it's it's good .\nC : my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership gives people certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take ownership and , innovative thought with .\nC : in in reality here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original briefing and then the personal coach and the and then having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite quite quite con confining framework to work within .\nC : and so it is leadership almost to the point of disempowering the the the team member , so but it's not bad leadership , it's just fairly strong , .\nC : it turns it turns the individual into more of like predetermined mechanism , as opposed to free , , without without doubt .\nB : so you think little too controlling or .\nA : controlling is not the word , the interactions are very structured .\nC : not co confining .\nA : structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling .\nA : don't think there's sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of , like consensus , we go around and we think about it , but that process actually says you have to do it in certain way .\nA : it doesn't tell you , , some ways that you might wanna be bit more creative in terms of the process , not the you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but it just comes back to us so slow in the email it it doesn't have , , messenger will go .\nB : what about teamwork ?\nC : did , you wanna comment craig ?\nD : reckon that was bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .\nD : if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have quick talk with them , that would've been lot easier .\nB : did did you get the email sent you ?\nD : not just yet .\nC : got the email .\nB : was wondering if that got there .\nB : so to to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier .\nC : in it , , , exactly .\nA : the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , that's the word .\nA : they don't support the team working together , , they're still very individual tools .\nC : if you , taking upon that idea , the way see this is that it's the the the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the principle of teamwork because the the tasks were divided , and then the work went on in isolation what you did while you were together , that was bit different , but , but but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said , first thing we have to do is come up with let's say design concept , and we sit here together and do it , that's what teamwork is .\nA : we had play-doh fun .\nC : to to say go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .\nC : not that we haven't done the best we could have done .\nC : i'm not dissatisfied with it .\nB : anything else to say on teamwork ?\nA : no , not really .\nB : what about the how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , like that ?\nB : did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un unsupportive ?\nC : the whiteboard , for me , is the thing would use all the time , but it's not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on board as opposed to in like in text .\nC : and then we could then keep our ideas building on that .\nC : know that people who design cars and in aviation they quite often just have simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as context to walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .\nB : and point at ?\nC : it wasn't until we had this here , , like at one point peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like , now he's thinking 'cause saw his book .\nC : but the the whiteboard could've actually been this continuing think could be , .\nB : so do you think producing prototype earlier in the process woulda been good idea ?\nA : the the focus of it lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and that is also does hinder us and things .\nA : it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint , or the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place , in the centre of the that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings .\nC : because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas imagine if i'd been encouraged to use paintbrush , , or whatever , would've actually used it , 'ca , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time .\nA : 'cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent lot of time doing that .\nA : and lot of the information on the powerpoints , don't think , , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , especially my slides , felt that they just as opposed to having to present them .\nC : no , not quite .\nB : what about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?\nD : they're bit clunky .\nA : having to tick it before you go off was bit hindering as , 'cause you're half way through thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump .\nB : know , at the very start of today like wrote whole load of , didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so i'm quite worried that i've just written over the top of it , but they'll have my paper anyway and haven't done that since .\nA : but the pen is is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't have to worry .\nA : so the pen's good .\nA : it's about the best thing .\nC : and on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .\nC : it just occurred to me that they all we only actually needed one computer .\nA : we only needed one computer and and the computer may not be conducive to meeting because you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , , it's useful but too many computers are just distracting .\nC : if there had been fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time .\nB : do you think the computers just provide distraction in meeting ?\nB : like to have things written down in front of me actually , like lot of the that was emailed to me ended up like writing down there so could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , about anybody else .\nB : what else any wh do i'm not really what they're looking for when they say new ideas found .\nB : is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today ?\nD : is this for the project or .\nC : the main one for me is that the process na in natural context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .\nC : so , that's new idea for me is like just that idea , it's hard to keep working forward on team team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .\nB : if we just had .\nB : it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend lot of time talking about the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , there another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but .\nB : really thi if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said like every hour everybody make yo just have have short meeting and then just just to have like something written down , just like milestone if you like rather than having meetings , but there you go .\nB : so in closing , haven't got my five minutes to go .\nB : thin there it five minutes to go .\nB : are the costs within the budget , yes they are .\nB : and is the project evaluated , yes it is .\nB : so now celebrate .\nC : so it so now we .\nA : and we have ninja homer .\nB : now write the final report .\nD : do we the other ones are ?\nB : what are you doing now ?\nB : that is lovely .\nD : said ninja homer .\nC : what did you call it ?\nA : see it looks like homer simpson but it's electronic so it's made in japan .\nB : so is that is that just is that just logo or does it do anything ?\nA : it's just logo .\nB : just logo and then like ninja homer , .\nA : the the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it .\nA : you can wear homer , you can throw homer when you're frustrated , doh .\nB : no , that's , it's got i'm i'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , that would have been .\nB : from now on real reaction should give us more money .\nA : did learn something new , play-doh is useful .\nA : no it is it is .\nA : it is useful and in in in in in in in conceptualizing , in being creative .\nA : 'cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get sense for .\nA : like we were playing with the play-doh and the ideas came with the play-doh rather than with everything else .\nA : you might wanna write that down .\nA : it's just , i'm just fiddling with the play-doh , and i'm going it's kinda .\nC : no , it's true , .\nD : i'd forgot how good play-doh smells .\nB : it smells funny doesn't it .\nC : and some play-dohs are actually edible aren't they ?\nB : like the for it has to be , .\nA : no , all play-doh is edible .\nD : they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds .\nA : it's just wheat , it's the that your mom could make with preservatives and it's helpful to the creative process .\nB : so to wha what are your summarising words about play-doh ?\nA : it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch .\nA : and it helps you to understand dimension as .\nA : that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , whereas on piece of paper , on computer , on board , even with three d_ graphic thing it still , it requires lot of tangible , that's word .\nD : it's not very tangible .\nA : it becomes tangible .\nB : if there's anything else we needed to discuss .\nB : that that's about it really .\nB : just sit still for little while .\nA : we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate .\nB : i'm the little the little thing'll pop up any minute now .\nA : can we turn off the microphones ?\nB : if the meeting's over then so ."], ["<t> The group discussed their initial

damn trendy .\nA : so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic .\nC : was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , .\nD : the universal ones .\nC : so presumably that might be an idea to put into .\nA : but but to sell it for twenty five you need lot of neat features .\nC : 'cause , what twenty five euros , that's about , fifteen pounds or so ?\nD : it's about that .\nC : and that's quite lot for remote control .\nD : my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black .\nD : as you said they come with the t_v_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so we could think about colour ?\nD : make that might make it bit different from the rest at least .\nD : and as you say , we need to have some gimmick , so something like if you lose it and you can whistle , those things ?\nC : the the keyrings , .\nD : because we always lose our remote control .\nB : being as marketing exper expert will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ?\nB : what are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ?\nB : what speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market .\nB : so before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having good look also , because people really li like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their c_d_ player , m_p_ three player like any electronic devices .\nB : they really want to have something good , having good design in their hands , so , yes , all this .\nA : what do we think what do we think good size would be for this ?\nC : so , we're looking for .\nC : we're , carry on .\nA : 'cause know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like hundred buttons on it , or you could have really small slim one but then you could lose it easily .\nD : then you lose it , .\nD : more like p_d_a_ , just hand held , like , 'cause .\nC : for for remember we're trying to make it for twelve euros fifty .\nD : no , wasn't , no wasn't thinking of the screen of like p_d_a_ but .\nC : we'll have to i'll we're having another meeting in half an hour so we should all look into bit , actually , no , we'll allocate .\nC : so you do the looking around at other remote controls .\nC : if you could come up with shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into how how it's made i_e_ like how you make it all in one , how what materials are available to you whatever .\nC : and , other instructions will come from the personal coach .\nC : which will probably just usurp what said so shapes and colours and how to make it attractive .\nD : so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ?\nC : and you look at competition and design .\nC : so we have .\nC : and no doubt we'll get .\nC : we'll get warnings for next meetings as .\nC : shall 't imagine these are worth much .\nC : fashion into electronic ."], ["<t> The

</t>  <t> The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design. </t>  <t> The Project Manager will ask to what extent the company logo must be incorporated into the design. </t>  <t> The remote will feature speech recognition and programmable channel and volume preferences. </t>  <t> The number of button functions will be limited to make the remote user-friendly. </t>  <t> The remote will have an organic shape and feature some yellow coloring and glow-in-the-dark material. </t>  <t> The group seemed to have some minor technical difficulties when opening their presentations. </t> ", "C : minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television .\nC : so the all in one idea goes out the window .\nC : and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .\nC : so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ?\nC : raring to go ?\nC : need to plug you in .\nB : so how sh do you want me to hold it ?\nA : it's inspired design .\nC : there we go , just screw on in .\nC : gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function eight .\nB : so , after that ?\nC : that's the wee blue one .\nC : blue one eight .\nC : should do it , good one .\nB : me again , rajan the marketing expert .\nB : as we have decided in the last meeting that have to find out , , .\nC : hold on , .\nC : and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at time .\nB : actually , have to see the other , .\nB : yes , have to look at the market potential for this product , , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our net profit or our aims or not ?\nC : press five to start it first .\nB : then the methodology adopted to find out all this was market survey .\nB : detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , what problems they do encounter in all this type of things .\nB : and what we got was , we found that if you , what they what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market .\nB : seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly .\nB : they are not so good looking .\nB : so , we have to put stress on this , we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .\nB : and yes that's wi this will definitely , this can definitely put enhance our sales .\nB : and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also .\nB : so even if the available market goes for the available even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros , which which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have good better better look designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these remote controls .\nB : then and the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .\nB : because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive because believe that technology is useful only if the consumers they want to use it .\nB : otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things .\nB : so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also .\nB : so we have to take care of this fact also .\nB : it was function want to go to .\nC : you wanna go back ?\nB : then if we look at this slide , these are in your shared documents , you can see , like , .\nD : so , was just gonna say , what was the question for this ?\nD : or is are you coming on to that ?\nB : look all the market potential , what how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales .\nD : so these percentages are are what ?\nB : these are different age group persons like , open it in another way .\nB : if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in remote control or not , we can find that they up to thirty five years age group we have very good disliking for this this point , like for speech recognition in remote control .\nB : so we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five , and and that most of the users of the rem t_v_ are belong to this age group .\nB : so we should look .\nC : we're als we we're looking at who buys it as .\nB : we can look at that that factor also , so yes .\nC : which the twenty five to thirty five is usual , .\nB : so , and and then yes .\nC : fifteen to twe .\nB : if we look at this data how how how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market .\nB : they find that thirt thirty five percent thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate remote control .\nB : so it should be in such way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl spe proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn .\nB : they need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote controls .\nB : so this is also very goo major factor to loo take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales .\nB : so this is all about market potential by me .\nC : follow on with helen ?\nD : , that's , .\nB : we have to take that out .\nC : so we do .\nC : fun and games .\nC : if the cable's gonna be long enough .\nC : kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as .\nB : brian , this one also .\nD : turn my computer quickly if that's .\nB : very much brian .\nB : if you want me to help , .\nD : and then what do press , eight ?\nB : it's not coming .\nB : function eight , .\nC : there you go .\nB : computer adjusting , .\nD : and then how do press the the big one , to get it on to the big five and press that again to get it off as do ?\nC : five and escape'll bring it back and just the left button for advancing .\nD : so i'm the interface design designer , user interface designer , i'm concerned with what effect the apparatus should have on the user and i'm i'm also want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so we as company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's big concern of ours .\nD : and how do press just the next button ?\nC : just left left mouse button .\nD : so looked at existing designs and also the information that raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike .\nD : and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main buyers of of our t_v_ .\nD : so what they like and what they find fashionable .\nD : and ergonomics , we said , haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , but that comes up , .\nC : that can come under arlo as .\nD : and the findings , the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .\nD : that's what people want to do .\nD : so they need to be included , , but i've got some pictures here of some leading ones .\nD : how to get to them , do press five is it ?\nC : if you if you escape then you can see your bar .\nD : haven't got my glasses on so hope it's this one .\nD : these are two leading remote controls at the moment .\nD : they're grey , they've this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , and they don't look very exciting .\nD : personally prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's bit more sleek with more of this silver , , but there you go , that's what we're up against , and we can do much better than that .\nC : we hope so .\nD : five , , .\nD : we need to the ergonomics is quite important , .\nC : particularly if we've there was bit in raj's about r_s_i_ and things as .\nD : and not too edgy and like box , more hand-held more not as computery and or organic , , more organic shape .\nD : simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , so what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how it looks .\nD : hand-held and portable is portamint is important because t_f_t_ have just released is it remote control for presentations or and big seven inch big screen , anyway , so , no seven inches isn't that big but anyway so hand-held and portable and about other functions for t_v_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , so we forget about that .\nC : it's like , .\nC : and also the company want to keep it stuck to the t_v_ for to keep down the production time .\nD : it's for one t_v_ , .\nD : and so the last thing which quickly mentioned in the other one was bit of gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark which does already exist but it's not very widely used don't think .\nD : easy finder with the whistle function , or rechargeable station because it's pain when you run out of batteries .\nD : and that , , that's it .\nA : so , noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , and was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?\nA : or if is that function we want in the remote ?\nD : haven't been able to , or some voice .\nC : do you have trouble whistling ?\nA : don't , but know lot of people do .\nA : it just it has to be certain whistle too , ?\nC : suppose that's true .\nC : suppo you could you could have the you could have the instead of whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , , where are you ?\nA : that's costly though .\nA : much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , , and then , what would the response be ?\nA : it beeps back at you ?\nA : let me set this up .\nA : so plug it in , press five ?\nC : function eight for the the .\nA : or function eight ?\nD : you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .\nA : it's just to lock it in .\nA : it's got it .\nA : so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you , so it's good you went first , and jotted down some notes as to what are the needs and what novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .\nC : let's remember that .\nA : so raj told us that consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and he also mentioned that the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour .\nA : lot of the buttons aren't used , and he mentioned that they're not fun to use .\nA : and novel feature which we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be little microphone on it , and any noise over certain threshold it'll pick up as distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say here am of this sort .\nC : but surely that would have to be specific rather than above threshold 'cause if you had loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .\nA : , that's true .\nA : you could have tha that would be consideration to take into account yes .\nC : didn't mean to derail you there .\nA : tha that's for later down the road , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , and not computery , , so more low tech and not too many buttons .\nA : so took these all into consideration and also have some limitations from the boss .\nA : and practical limitations which kinda threw out the window .\nA : and so did little research and unfortunately all had to work on was our our corporate archives of the products we've made before , which include , , space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains or or high speed train .\nC : is that what that is ?\nA : and having personally worked with all these products have deal of experience with with industrial design of these .\nC : if you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with remote control , .\nA : so , figured , just put all together .\nA : you got caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t_v_ , and as for the user interface problem , , too many buttons .\nA : give it one button and and it's , for the the cowboy in all of us i'm not quite what the the function is there but it's you could have .\nD : like that design .\nC : is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ?\nA : so missed the budget thing , it was fifty million euros ?\nA : and we gotta sell twenty five of them ?\nB : fifty million was prof as profit .\nC : now it's fif fifty million euros we've gotta we've gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and half euros time .\nA : so mixed those numbers .\nA : more realistically then , we need product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic , , that should be just like tenth of the price or less .\nA : an energy source which'd probably just be your regular batteries , we don't wanna have it .\nC : would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ?\nC : is that is that gonna mark up lot ?\nD : or little base station , .\nA : , we could do that too .\nA : hadn't thought of that .\nD : that might cost more though , 'cause with batteries we don't need to provide , provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries .\nC : if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just lead with self connecting brake in it , so don't t'd up up the price that much .\nD : battery in it , kinda .\nA : so so the unirs the user interface the canonical user interface for these would be just bunch of buttons , but since we're cutting edge company , we will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product .\nA : and lastly the transmission interface is , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .\nA : so here's , schematic that my apprentice designer gave me .\nA : as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and it's got little operating procedure that looks something like that .\nA : and suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in company designing remote controls if we didn't they were so personal preferences , programmable options which just require small amount of memory , non volatile memory , just so the user can put in their favourite channels and their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .\nD : that's good idea actually like the programmable options .\nA : and the , the bells and whistles that we mentioned , they take more budgeting , more technical expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .\nA : that's all got .\nC : very much , i'll take that back .\nC : also so notice got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is let's see , i'll find it myself , ta nah .\nA : don't think we need to screw it in .\nA : just push it .\nC : we had that to dis-include teletext because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway .\nC : dunno what oracle would have to say with that but never mind .\nC : it's only for the television , which i'm presuming means it's for specific television , and instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .\nC : everything , all their the corporate website and everything's yellow .\nC : and the logo the slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics exactly how incorpor , if you're going for globular shape you could have it working its way round it .\nC : so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have .\nC : now , we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , interface we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll take that one as read .\nC : we'll use the the basic functions for television .\nD : although the the danger with that is , it could look bit cheap .\nC : not enough buttons you mean ?\nC : so sorta strike balance between few and or it looks like we're just cutting on the do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it .\nD : on the number of buttons , functions and .\nC : raj you could find out what people would think about that , or they'll send some information about that , about what people , whether people would require teletext in remote teletext option in remote control .\nC : so take it your position arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the gimmick but not too complicated gimmick .\nC : so the inkling i'm getting from little bits of web chatter that i'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in t_f_t_ display , interactive display .\nC : however that does sound bit like the more complicated design that rav raj said people didn't like .\nC : although if there's if you think about standard interfaces that people use already , windows-style drop down menus or whatever , that's bit , going bit far but like in basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit menu at the top you have it goes to different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple .\nC : glow in the dark , is that with light inside it or is it glow in the dark material ?\nD : glow in the dark material was thinking .\nD : so that would be cheaper than light .\nB : may say something about ?\nB : actually it's really really very important point as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room .\nB : but are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time .\nD : often lost was that , .\nB : but if we add speech recognition as as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control replies to something something and it glows in the dark .\nB : both these factors both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , and this will definitely enhance our market sales , so we should take it into consideration also .\nC : speech recognition take it don't , i've know of no products that use speech recognition .\nA : it's they're act there there was remote control that came out two years ago that had some basic speech recognition on it .\nA : you could programme it with your channels and then you say like b_b_c_ one and it goes to that channel .\nA : it didn't work very though because of this noise interference problem .\nA : they mentioned if the television says you are listening to b_b_c_ one .\nC : or an advert an advert for b_b_c_ two on b_b_c_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .\nA : , and so there was lot of this , you'd be watching the t_v_ and then all of sudden it'd it'd pick up noise and turn it off or or turn the volume off , but if you can work around that that noise problem .\nD : what about this might get bit too expensive actually , but what about something that's built into the t_v_ that you can press and it'll send out little signal like the ones that we can't hear that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .\nC : that's good idea .\nC : so like backwards remote from the telly .\nD : if you find if .\nA : and then it would do just , subtractive cancellation of the noise .\nA : what you could do then would be you have remote controlled by the t_v_ speaker , or not remo i'm , microphone by the t_v_ speaker and transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't expect the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their t_v_s .\nD : that's the only thing , .\nA : but , then you have like the little se separate module by the t_v_ speaker which , and then the remote control would know what's being produced by the television .\nC : that we should just stick on , .\nD : that comes with our remote control .\nC : and that's basic r_f_ frequency so it'll be cheap .\nA : that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again .\nA : if you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it .\nA : you just say , whatever you whatever you want the remote for , to change the channel or to turn the t_v_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within , within hearing range .\nA : and it could be somewhere in the room that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job .\nD : that could also be built into the t_v_ though , which might make our remote control bit obsolete .\nA : hopefully we're we're ahead of the curve .\nC : it might do us out of job .\nC : like the whole remote feedback thing .\nC : so rather than and that also takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very and things like that , so and expense and the time .\nD : and the expense .\nC : so if we're going to go like the thing about the there's the problem with the t_f_t_ or the thing is if you're also wanting the the organic globby feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen .\nC : but not thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not problem .\nC : and how are you about the glow in the dark material ?\nC : is that contrast contra .\nD : not even all of it 'cause we said colours and fashion were important so just like little line that's around the outside and then you can make the rest different colour .\nA : no the material's cheap but it's just the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it , and then if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it it won't glow any more .\nC : so if it's dow it's .\nC : or if it's down under the couch cushions which is where usually find mine .\nC : can use we can still use the glow in the dark as gimmick essentially , if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as , bright yellow logo in our our slogan .\nD : 'cause what , main slogan , .\nC : then they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have trimming as , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .\nD : 'cause , that more than finding it , that was more like if you're watching film in the dark , you can still see the remote control .\nC : alright , so sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of of feedback , remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .\nD : that was more of gimmick .\nC : do you think ?\nC : it makes it fairly unnecessary then .\nC : so scratch that .\nC : so we've got do we want to go with the t_f_t_ idea or the is that far too expensive ?\nA : we're getting lot of features now , .\nC : the find the finder things it's could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself .\nA : consideration too is that these remotes get abused lot , they get thrown around , there's good chance the the t_f_t_ screen would break or get damaged .\nA : they're pretty fragile .\nD : so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs t_f_t_ screen ?\nC : no , that was going on ravs raj's marketing research .\nC : so we'll stick with programmability for the buttons that we do have .\nC : so that's included in your sub-module , you were finding out about teletext .\nC : if you could find out that we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as bit of expensive , no ?\nB : it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi .\nA : no it's it's much cheaper than the t_f_t_ , it's just microphone and some some integrated circuits .\nC : is it not the circuits that cost , .\nA : and it'd it'd be small vocabulary speech recognition system , like .\nC : that takes back the r_f_ the r_f_ remote idea as .\nC : votes , let's vote .\nC : who wants t_f_t_ ?\nC : excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , ?\nC : speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design .\nD : if it's not too expensive it's good gimmick .\nC : and what else was ing of that haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability .\nB : glow in dark .\nC : and also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the slogan .\nC : can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as .\nC : so , it just helps me summarize them .\nC : and i'll put any i'm i'm putting anything do in there anyway , so pro project documents .\nD : and where is it ?\nC : on a_m_i_ scenario controller .\nA : so it should be when you save on your desktop , so it goes save as , or and then hit that little folder up thing again .\nB : it is in shared documents ?\nC : project documents , , it's on your desktop as .\nA : all the way to the top , that's up to desktop .\nA : and then project documents .\nB : it is not giving anything .\nC : and will tr getting strings of information , i'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as get them now , rather than was about to tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so did .\nA : did you get my email ?\nD : what as about the material is not this material , but more like this rubbery material , it's bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around lot .\nD : bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it feels bit different from all the other remote controls .\nD : the rubber rather than , .\nC : more flesh-like than plasticky .\nB : but we have to take care like but we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful .\nB : so , whatever material we use it should be .\nC : no , ethics , that's gonna cost us money .\nB : so we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care .\nD : wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , , that's good idea .\nC : it sme smells good for children .\nA : we could go comp .\nA : we could go completely out of the box and make the thing big red ball foam ball .\nA : and it's got the thing on the inside .\nA : and there's no buttons , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works .\nC : that sounds , it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have big yellow foam ball , , .\nA : and then ch children will love it .\nA : yellow , yellow ball .\nD : with the colour , does it have to be all yellow , do ?\nC : wouldn't , my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so just having it surrounding the logo .\nB : small logo with the like small yellow strip or yellow with the logo in it .\nD : having little bit .\nC : and i'll see if argue with boss about putting the what was it ?\nC : we put we put fashion into whoops , it's not working .\nC : can't believe i've forgotten it .\nC : we put the fashion in electronics .\nD : that's good one that .\nC : bet that'll catch on .\nC : any last worries , queries ?\nC : then , lunchtime , yay .\nC : that felt bit more like something with order and and reason to it than the last one .\nC : this is quite fun actually .\nC : really don't , .\nD : has anybody pressed , it vibrates .\nC : you've your first page .\nC : was just writing really big .\nD : got small writing .\nA : i've been using up the pages .\nD : don't wanna waste it .\nC : i've finished the meeting now .\nC : everybody needs questionnaire ."], ["<t> The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features. </t>  <t> He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design. </t>  <t> She discussed using voice recognition, an LCD screen, and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design. </t>  <t> He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device. </t>  <t> The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel. </t>  <t> He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device. </t>  <t> The group discussed colors and shapes further, and decided that the remote will be yellow, and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape. </t>  <t> The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand. </t>  <t> The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will build a prototype out of clay for the next meeting. </t>  <t> The remote will feature a rubber or latex casing. </t>  <t> Several shapes will be designed and shown to the public so that the most popular shape is chosen. </t>  <t> The remote will be yellow or partially yellow and have an organic shape. </t>  <t> The remote will feature speech recognition. </t>  <t> The remote will be powered by rechargeable batteries and come with a recharging stand. </t>  <t> The group had difficulty deciding how to incorporate the company's yellow color and the fruit and vegetable trend into the prototype design without the remote seeming overly gimmicky or childish. </t> ", "C : we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time .\nC : so switching over i've just left my first two screens .\nC : have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time .\nC : and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ?\nD : no , don't .\nC : then we shall start with presentation from raj .\nB : hi , me raj , again .\nB : in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this .\nB : so we have to look on this .\nB : first of all methodology .\nB : the met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in way we have done rec not only recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also factor which will affect our sales and profit .\nB : so what are our findings ?\nB : in our in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that people people do have preference for tho fancy mobi remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having functional look and feel good .\nB : so this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls .\nB : so we should take into we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as the third factor .\nB : so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls .\nD : the last one is the most important one , is it ?\nB : no the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good .\nB : the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative .\nB : we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are .\nB : so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that .\nB : so that indicates our technological advancement .\nB : and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated like this way .\nB : and it should be and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something .\nB : so that they could know how to use these remote controls .\nB : when we did fashions , recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that ?\nD : was just reading fruit and vegetables .\nD : hard to know how we are going to incorporate that .\nB : we have to , because you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming .\nA : we should make big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow .\nD : that's very good .\nB : so something like that we we should do .\nB : and people the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having plastic look , hard look .\nD : that's what we predicted anyway .\nB : so so that they could play with it while handi while handling it .\nB : so that should also be taken into consideration .\nB : so these are my views .\nD : the spongy , not real spongy , you can do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel ?\nB : so no it ca the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co .\nB : 'cause we it shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very for taking all these concerns into consideration , so we don't want to have any harm to the society , so so that's all .\nC : fruit and veg , there you go .\nC : just what of when of remote control .\nD : and were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ?\nB : we didn't find out any such point .\nD : or was it just .\nB : yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so .\nD : what is it ?\nA : no , it's got it's got it .\nD : and then five , ?\nD : so the interface concept .\nD : the interface specification , what people how they interact with it , .\nD : so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them , looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything .\nD : and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so bit of imagination .\nD : the findings , i've got some pictures to show you as .\nD : so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you have got buttons and you point it rather than having the output as stream of text .\nD : and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing .\nD : so for our remote control there is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but standard shape and play and those but buttons like the the top for on and off , , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use .\nD : and we've got some pictures of some new remote controls to show you .\nD : do press escape five ?\nC : no just escape should .\nD : or just escape , .\nD : still haven't got my glasses on .\nD : so these are the some of the pictures of existing ones .\nD : i'll just walk you through them .\nD : this one is voice recognition .\nD : and that's the idea we're going for .\nC : looks pretty complicated .\nD : there's an thing , which we thought could could get bit confusing and bit expensive as for us .\nD : this one is got scroll like mouse , which .\nC : like the middle button .\nD : and but i'm not exactly how you'd use that , like would the computer come , that's like the one , is it ?\nC : it's kinda like scrolling , , if if i'm thinking of the one , i've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll .\nD : but the one below that has got like little scroll function on the side .\nD : but presume that the functions must come up on the t_v_ screen .\nD : that's what that is .\nD : so these are just few ideas .\nD : again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , on that one .\nC : looks like looks like something out of jet .\nA : it looks threatening .\nD : it does look dangerous .\nA : it looks like .\nD : this one was really .\nD : it's it's got the programmability function that we talked about .\nD : you can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty .\nD : and that's really easy to use , bright , so like this one lot for our design .\nD : something like that would be good .\nC : the one thing about about these ones is these kl secured areas , i've seen lot of them with the the cover missing .\nC : so like have it hinge rather than clip on or whatever .\nD : so that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the t_v_ .\nD : and this one , the over-sized one , about you , but it's bit too gimmicky .\nD : don't think that will sell very .\nC : is that not to assist the blind , is it ?\nD : that's bit exactly .\nA : then blind don't watch t_v_ .\nC : no they do , they do .\nC : they listen to it .\nD : and this one is just pointing out .\nD : like some of these things the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .\nD : so that could that's bit confusing .\nD : but the buttons on this are it's just showing you how you can have different different buttons .\nD : they don't have to be all the same .\nD : so that's quite .\nC : but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ?\nD : so there are some of the findings .\nD : so we need to combine those ones and i've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in .\nD : it is , just in time , very handy .\nD : so incorporating that in our design would be good .\nD : it's you program it like you say , record , and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and like that , so that's and it's much .\nD : so that's quite .\nD : personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols were good , the , it does look smart , but for our budget , do you think that would be bit too expensive to have the .\nA : the and the other , .\nD : and the speech recognition , 'cause we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ?\nB : but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want fancy look , they want some new design , something new .\nD : but our budget , we've .\nC : it's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , .\nB : so even if we increase our cost little bit , within some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as as new design with fancy outlook , we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have good sales in the market .\nD : i'm not if the if for twenty five euros per twelve euros fifty manufacturing cost , .\nC : 't see tha although , to be to be they have got they are going crazy with the technology now , so that you've got your t_v_s and everything so the small but like the black and white , , it just doesn't look funky enough .\nC : but , , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour screens , ju wouldn't know about the costs of them .\nA : but price price not withstanding , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ?\nB : and the it will be easy because there will be , on screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click , whatever they wa .\nD : that's the thing , because .\nA : but but the thing is when you use remote control , you never look at it , ?\nA : you're looking at the t_v_ and and it's it just seems like needless so which vegetable ?\nD : that's true , .\nD : and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so i'm not about the .\nD : it's it's , it's good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , .\nD : child-friendly , this was good , as you pointed out the the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's good shape and the organic is we could make vegetabley round shape , .\nC : we could make .\nD : know , carrot .\nC : si since we're going for the the the company colours , your lemon wasn't that far and if it doesn't work , we've just made lemon .\nA : the the lemon .\nA : what are the options ?\nD : but we don't want it to be .\nD : the child-friendly , .\nD : easy to use , it seems quite easy to use .\nD : like the the different shapes of the buttons and .\nD : that's good idea to go for .\nC : like like the colourful buttons as .\nD : and the mouse one , it was good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing .\nC : we are marketing to twenty five to thirty five , so most people will have come in contact with that use .\nD : so they'd be able to use that , as said i'd presume it would come up on the screen .\nD : so there you go .\nC : and that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the t_v_ maker , so .\nD : so that's the user interface design .\nD : so , i'll take this out now then .\nA : so there are lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , and i'll i'll give you the , , technical considerations for those .\nD : there you go .\nC : looks like it .\nC : was just thinking the self same thing .\nA : and i'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it .\nA : so , the way i'm gonna do this is we're gonna take look at some old remote controls , see how they work , reuse the the vital essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations and keep it all within budget .\nA : so , looking inside very simple remote control .\nA : this is what they sent me .\nA : here's the competition , suppose .\nA : you open it up , there's circuit board inside , and there's chip , processor , the t_a_ one one eight three five , which receives input from the buttons , and ch , it's very they're very cheap remote .\nC : so this is standard off the shelf chip , is it ?\nA : this remote costs nothing , .\nA : so that takes signals from the buttons and translates it into sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the to the l_e_d_ light , which kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared light signal to the television .\nA : here it is .\nA : so this is the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the no , this is very old one , so now with the new technology this is minimally small and cheap thing to make .\nC : so can we make them to any size we like or is there minimum or ?\nC : they gotta be almost key-ring .\nA : so this is what we need to have for certain .\nA : so , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , , what's it gonna be , the board we have to use the same set-up , processor , we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard .\nA : so for the casing , this an e-mail got from our manufacturing team , , we have bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , latex , double-curved , curved .\nA : so lots of choices , what do we think ?\nA : or sponge , , isn't on there , .\nC : like la latex has kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it .\nD : i'm not about the sponge .\nA : it's very elasticy for .\nC : and that would also give it kinda durability and and ther that's also sorta relatively cheap to cast .\nA : so so , here are plastic , latex .\nC : so plastic initial plastic with latex kinda sheath ?\nD : like the rubber , the stress balls , , , that could be bit of gimmick like it's good to hold and .\nC : what that is .\nA : so something with give to it .\nD : and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around .\nA : and and the colour is yellow , ?\nD : yellow incorporated , .\nC : or at least incorporating , .\nC : forgot we're what other standard silver other parts or .\nD : the buttons like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or if we're having buttons actually , don .\nA : so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ?\nC : quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself .\nA : so multi-coloured buttons .\nD : you do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and like that , .\nC : or limit even just limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .\nD : makes it easy to use .\nD : that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish .\nC : although this also comes to shape as .\nC : if we are gonna make it novel double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , bit comfier , .\nA : so the shape we wanna go how exactly ?\nA : double what about banana ?\nD : like an hour glass figure , is that what you're thinking of , or just like it's not .\nC : it's , , that that'd be that's comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it .\nD : we could make novelty remote controls .\nA : like we could have big banana shaped remote control , 'cause it's yellow fruit , ?\nC : , like , .\nC : and lemon might be little hard to grip .\nD : but then how would you point it ?\nD : how would you point it ?\nA : it doesn't matter which end you point , .\nA : we could have little l_e_d_s on each end .\nC : they only cost pennies .\nB : appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices .\nB : that what our data shows that , so this this the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people now spongy .\nD : i'm i'm not about the banana idea .\nA : so spongy banana re .\nC : that that does it does seem bit again childish .\nD : just draw on the fruit and vegetable shape .\nD : and what else did you say about fashions ?\nD : what was trendy ?\nA : see so an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have stem perhaps and it'd be axially symmetric .\nD : and spongy , .\nD : like what's what's that , don't even know the name of it , some , where it's like looks like little snowman thing .\nD : the name of that .\nA : so it'd look like this kinda .\nD : that's what was thinking .\nA : like gourd almost , or squash of some sort ?\nD : that's what they are .\nD : 'cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and .\nA : and it has clear top and bottom so so you could say , , it transmits from this end .\nC : why the hell not .\nC : let's that'll make us fifty million euros .\nD : what do you guy what do you think ?\nC : it's dra you don't necessarily have to have it clearly identified as fruit just to have that fruitish shape , ?\nB : then only we can relate it with something .\nC : we can relate it by advertising or .\nA : so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ?\nB : or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have public survey , let the public choose what they want .\nC : there's good man .\nC : there's good idea .\nA : , since you're the marketing guy .\nA : we'll , we could do that .\nB : will be happy to do that .\nD : and buttons would , did we say ?\nD : different shapes of buttons ?\nC : su for the specific functions , , up and down , play , stop .\nA : so so buttons .\nC : they've got , , they've got standard intuitive things that are always used .\nA : just like that .\nA : with the scroll-wheel or no ?\nD : what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ?\nC : speech recognition , , so we need microphone presumably .\nA : could put the microphone here .\nA : there's the microphone .\nA : where should put the microphone ?\nC : ho wel are we that scroll wheel does give ease of use ?\nD : those ideas saw were just for inspiration , .\nC : glad , we're not doing this for real .\nD : no i'm not .\nA : can do some user test with scroll-wheels , ?\nC : and if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone would put it sub-centrally , so it's .\nA : so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or there's the mic .\nC : so it can be held and we really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition .\nD : so let's not use the whiteboard any more .\nD : and so what else was there ?\nD : the what about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ?\nD : are we just gonna leave that ?\nC : still like it .\nC : but that's me .\nD : you still like it .\nD : 'cause we've got the technological innovation with the speech recognition system .\nC : yes , or it's just going bit too far .\nC : we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes .\nD : 'cause it could .\nC : don't wanna overkill .\nD : especially with yellow .\nC : 'cause like if we how good is the speech recognition thing ?\nC : do we want to go for buttons , do we want to just have device that sits and pretends it's fruit ?\nD : then you put it in the fruit bowl ?\nC : , and then you just tal like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly .\nA : they can work from you don't have to hold it .\nA : it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , they have fruits all round them .\nC : make them make them think of fruit , .\nA : now just make they don't eat the remote .\nC : some like think of fruit that could sit independently on its own like , , an apple .\nD : do we need buttons ?\nC : then it's just apple so , yellow apples though .\nD : quite like the shape .\nD : quite like the design of that , 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got quite steady base .\nC : , that's good .\nD : and as we say we we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things .\nA : but but , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close .\nA : it can sit at distance and pick it up still .\nC : so like you could actually , gives you the options .\nB : or we can we can do one thing , we can just have remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such way that any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .\nB : so whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , , it will look .\nC : so selection of casings .\nD : 'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ?\nC : it fi it fits with fits with marketing like like mobiles , .\nD : you said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have choice .\nB : like if this is like if this is mobile phone we will design casing in such way like half of , we need not to have full cover , we will just have half of cover , ?\nB : if somebody wants it in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give banana shape look .\nB : if somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that .\nB : it will give apple shape look .\nB : so in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without .\nD : we still need the buttons in the same places thought , don't we ?\nB : button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .\nC : you can standardise those , .\nD : that's the other side .\nB : buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the , not not the upper side .\nB : so from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you you can have banana look or apple look , whatever .\nB : so in that way we need not to have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape .\nC : tho if you're gonna have facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them .\nC : it doesn't really 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with microphone so that you can place it face down .\nC : and you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the .\nA : so , we decided on material , ?\nC : so you've narrowed it down to half dozen options .\nA : so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or .\nD : because , i'm not if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because we should just take the inspiration from the fruit and because what , wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as they said .\nC : so we stick with what we've got there .\nD : they wanted something that looks fancy and fruit could be bit of too much of gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going bit gaudy with the yellow , .\nD : we could make it pale yellow .\nC : it's gotta be our company's yellow .\nC : so again like we could have , , we could quite easily have the the main body be different colour , but have kinda going round , .\nD : we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan .\nC : even if not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour , so blue and yellow tend to go to we together .\nC : so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it thing .\nC : it's it's the more you move it , it's got wee thing inside that just kinda powers it .\nA : as for the energy source , , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that .\nA : we can use hand-dynamo .\nA : what that means , we crank it ?\nA : it's like those watches that you so , this might be an idea that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .\nD : like with those watches that you twist .\nC : like that , .\nA : so if it if it's not working , people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing .\nB : but but but do you think that it will be good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ?\nC : you shake it and scream at it .\nD : it is , .\nB : because then people have to , like if the cell is out of bat , to mo .\nC : it does leave them with an obligation to especially if they want to use it sp specifically as voice activated .\nB : because most of the people .\nC : then if it's just sitting on the , .\nD : then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then .\nC : what are the other options ?\nA : there's solar power .\nB : solar power will also not be good idea , because then they have to keep their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight .\nC : i'm i'm with raj on that , , , i've got i've got no i've got north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window .\nA : so probably just .\nD : but like just normal light ?\nB : we should rechargeable battery will be good idea .\nB : they can they can recharge it .\nC : that idea that just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that bother is having , , having rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as stand , but for using it as recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition .\nD : and we're very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as ?\nD : like like hand like one of those portable phones thing .\nB : that's , exactly .\nA : so rechargeable battery .\nA : the user interface , the buttons , we talked about this already .\nC : what's chip on print ?\nC : what's , never mind .\nA : the the electronics , the more features we add , this one .\nA : so the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect .\nA : but we can keep it all under budget .\nA : so yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through .\nA : so just in time .\nC : and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping .\nD : just in time .\nA : and keeping the screen out .\nC : we're we're we're excuse i've just deleted that whole thing .\nC : we're running out of time , so if you could .\nC : was that you ?\nC : that was your bit's covered , dele accidentally deleted what was supposed to say next .\nA : that was that was it .\nB : excuse me , bri you just touch the pad , .\nA : so control eight , ?\nD : mine seems to have turned off .\nD : 't do anything .\nC : and touch the pad .\nC : it's actually shut down .\nD : it's on , but there's nothing on the screen .\nC : now what we have our next meeting's in half an hour and what would like you to do is work on giving me model in clay .\nA : try flipping the screen down .\nA : get to do it , too .\nC : so , , luckily we chose simple shape .\nC : and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches .\nA : save everything to the shared documents , is that ?\nC : hope recover this , 'cause i've accidentally deleted it .\nC : which doesn't really help me much .\nD : i've saved mine already .\nC : can you save that send that last one again , , raj , as still can't find it on the .\nB : it was under different name .\nB : will show you , in shared documents .\nB : you didn't get that .\nB : will send new .\nB : i'll put it in shared documents , again .\nC : project , project documents .\nB : project documents , , put it in the shared documents .\nC : that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in project documents .\nC : project documents is on the desktop .\nB : but cou can't open that , because it asks for some username or password .\nB : i'll show you .\nA : these lapel mics are trouble .\nC : if it it just ca it just came up on my on my agenda .\nC : presumably there's clay somewhere .\nC : light , light , .\nC : there you go .\nC : and we're using this our basic chip set , so it's all good .\nA : are we done with our meeting ?\nB : excuse me , brian .\nC : we're almost done , .\nB : you have to keep your pen separate , because used your pen .\nC : still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and .\nC : so we came up with that , that's .\nC : shoulda something like that .\nC : if kn see knew that .\nC : shoulda engineered it so we ended up making diffi difficult shape .\nC : just for cruelty .\nC : wonder if they mean like literally make it , buttons and everything .\nB : so sh should should we leave now , brian ?\nD : we can do buttons .\nB : or we are going to discuss something ?\nC : no , that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , 'cause i'm confused .\nD : no i'm good .\nC : we'll probably get questionnaire in minute , it's there we go .\nC : warning , finish meeting now .\nC : rounded it up far too fast .\nC : where are we going ?\nC : my documents , that's not what want .\nC : my project documents .\nC : there we go ."], ["<t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group. </t>  <t> Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons. </t>  <t> It also featured scroll wheels for channel control. </t>  <t> The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind. </t>  <t> The Project Manager announced to the group that with

very good leadership. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product. </t>  <t> The remote will come in several designs: two will have different fruit or vegetable shapes, one of which will feature speech recognition in lieu of

forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do .\nB : excuse me forgot my copy .\nC : alright , , .\nC : he's gonna get his pen .\nC : will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ?\nA : there's good news ?\nC : we have budget problems .\nC : i'm afraid you're all sacked .\nC : don't even have this on .\nC : have you got presentation to make ?\nB : no , not mine yet .\nC : so it's just your your show .\nA : we should bring so that the camera can see .\nD : we made three for you .\nD : one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look .\nC : don't recall tomato .\nD : , we had some red left over .\nD : so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition .\nD : the yellow there is the the slogan , , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple .\nD : if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition .\nC : so the buttons would be like , individual users , or .\nD : and they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there .\nD : i'm not about that .\nD : and this one is the one more like the one that we looked at earlier .\nD : you can have look at that if you want .\nC : like the feel of it , like the feel of it .\nD : that one is no , it's delicate .\nD : that's that's already got its stand that one .\nD : that's it stand .\nD : it does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand .\nD : the black on the back is the slogan .\nC : and obvious there , if it's standing up , , .\nD : that , we did think of that .\nD : if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black line in the middle .\nC : like that from its centre .\nD : so and that's the transmit the l_e_d_ thing .\nD : these are the two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down .\nD : we were weren't about putting them there , because it's it could get bashed .\nC : where you're , , were you're holding it .\nD : if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands .\nD : don't think that's real sized .\nD : it would have to be bit bigger .\nC : scale model , .\nD : that's speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like little walkie-talkie as for speak recognition .\nD : and then the buttons .\nD : self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them .\nD : tried to keep it simple .\nD : that's the charging base prongs at the bottom .\nD : we used those .\nD : and then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one .\nC : alright , excellent .\nD : it's not in the traditional place , but it's quite an obvious place .\nC : it's out of the way as , suppose , so .\nD : so there we go and and we have the banana-based one too .\nA : this one is , suppose for the younger audiences .\nC : so so barney the banana .\nA : more friendly type of , .\nA : it's to induce more television watching suppose or .\nC : excellent , just what we need .\nA : say it for the camera .\nC : lo loch ness banana .\nC : to have options at least .\nC : and there are issues , there are issues .\nD : so are there any improvements or issues or .\nA : it won't stand .\nA : just let it lie down , it wont stand .\nC : main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .\nC : let's just enter in the evaluation criteria .\nC : unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , it's gonna cost us fourteen point six euros .\nC : so we have to rea , i've accidentally highlighted somehow .\nA : what's on the on the left ?\nC : there we go .\nC : why is it doing that ?\nC : there we go .\nC : so , in order to save our two euros was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .\nD : more like traditional remote control .\nC : it's already got shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved in and out .\nC : and by doing so no , hold on .\nC : doesn't save us quite as much .\nC : what's going on with this again .\nA : why is the double curved two of them ?\nB : and double curve on both sides ?\nB : this is double-curve , no ?\nC : that's curve in and out .\nB : this is double-curve .\nB : it this one is single curve .\nB : 'cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides .\nC : no , it means double curved as in like single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .\nD : like an shape .\nC : might be wrong though .\nB : like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side .\nC : don't think that counts as curve , that's just shape .\nC : curvature is like the this case .\nA : 'cause that's the the biggest expense there , .\nC : and why why i've got it two , , 't seem to select any more however .\nA : got two of them .\nA : can work around that cut things out .\nA : but you should be one .\nC : it's meant to be one , , why put two in there , but hold on till find it , this shift button might be stuck again .\nC : no the shift button's stuck in .\nC : so that would take away three , which would give us that's fine .\nB : should you can do one thing .\nA : so we're we should fire the accountants .\nC : eleven eleven euros sixty .\nC : we cou not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately .\nD : so we could even add something .\nA : fire the accountants .\nA : we could add things .\nA : if you click back in that bottom cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys .\nA : does that work ?\nC : know , that just extends it as .\nB : you just select one box outsi , this box .\nB : then move it with the help of this .\nC : it one of the buttons is sticking , .\nB : just just , just minute .\nB : no input , like this .\nB : no it's not .\nC : no , it's 'cause the the shift button's stuck , .\nB : it's not working .\nA : is it the other shift button ?\nB : should we ask meli should we ask our technical expert melissa ?\nC : no that's fine .\nC : we've worked out what it would be anyway .\nA : did you try both shift buttons ?\nA : it could be the other side .\nA : that's too bad .\nC : so that's finances and what we what could we reckon we could add ?\nC : suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got .\nD : we could add something , but if what do you we're trying to save money , so .\nD : if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to .\nD : but if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , , feel free to add it .\nD : it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place now .\nC : that's that's , so project evaluation .\nC : we have under twelve euros fifty .\nC : project process , how do we think that went ?\nC : are we happy ?\nA : we have winning product .\nC : we've been writing this up for months .\nD : it went quite smoothly .\nC : room for creativity , were we happy with that ?\nD : we were very creative .\nC : no , mea it means individually .\nC : yes , no , ?\nC : so we're just gonna .\nC : you're all get you're all getting raise .\nD : everyone got enough input , .\nC : and means , .\nC : the technical was brilliant .\nC : let's buy more .\nC : what , new ideas found , means , to be honest .\nA : these pens are are neat though .\nB : these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark like that .\nB : we discussed all the new ideas , but we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these , but we we are using these scroll buttons like this .\nB : these are new ideas we and new shapes , everything .\nC : so just general thumbs up for all of us then .\nC : that unfortunately is too quick .\nA : so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , .\nC : that's it , another couple of days holiday pay might be order for all of you .\nC : let's see if get this bloody thing to work .\nA : we should start cleaning up the clay .\nB : so so brian , have you have you finished ?\nC : does it go back in , does it ?\nA : something we should get .\nC : what this is but it's really really annoying .\nC : have , yes .\nB : mine needs also this .\nB : at last mine is also the presentation .\nC : , you've got more , .\nD : you got presentation , .\nC : it didn't bother to tell me that on this thing .\nB : is the project evaluated , that is mine .\nC : doesn't tell me .\nC : you're doing that .\nC : we evaluated ourselves , we thought we were .\nD : love to eat that now .\nA : anybody clay covered banana .\nD : green banana now .\nD : it's this as , , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of rubbery latex , new material that we've got .\nC : wonder which cell do want .\nA : it's fun to touch .\nC : didn't realise you had that bit .\nD : could you pass the tomato .\nB : so now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the of our product .\nB : how we are going to means at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not .\nB : how mu what rating we will give to these products .\nB : so this is will be team work , we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything .\nB : so what methodology will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .\nB : we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product .\nB : then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ?\nB : means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays .\nB : so this is also an important factor for our evaluation also .\nB : then marketing strategy of the company .\nB : as we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental .\nB : so but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , like keeping keeping in mind all the safety issues .\nB : so now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale .\nB : i'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on board .\nC : the board working again , is it ?\nB : the user requirem .\nA : do we have the the marker for the board ?\nA : there it is .\nB : so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product .\nB : first of all comes user requirement .\nB : so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not .\nB : will first would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?\nD : it had all the basic buttons that they needed as as the new technology that people said they wanted .\nB : so what do you think you will personally give .\nC : when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t_v_ , so , we haven't actually got working model yet .\nD : does it work ?\nD : would say seven .\nD : seven is good , , isn't it ?\nD : 't true or false ?\nD : no tr one is true .\nB : one is means highest ranking , .\nB : but highest ranking is seven , or one ?\nC : no it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth , i'll go for one .\nA : no that's false .\nB : so it's one for from your point of view .\nB : and what do you say our industrial expert ?\nA : it's hard to know .\nA : give it two .\nB : you can you can tell on on the like she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our interface expert .\nB : but you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?\nA : it might even exceed it .\nA : but there is shortage of buttons .\nA : i'm gonna give it two .\nB : and what about you , brian ?\nB : you will go for one .\nC : basic requirements but of the pro of the project .\nB : for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and , lower end .\nC : come on that was the tha .\nB : and the third one is what you ge that is not fruit look .\nB : but if person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .\nB : no , don't buy our product , because we are we like this only .\nB : so we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and .\nD : is that no is that not trends ?\nB : no , personally as marketing expert don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give range of products , range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give variety of different things .\nB : some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape .\nB : so you can what shape person will like .\nB : so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers .\nB : and by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also .\nD : but in electronics , , it's not always quite so you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates .\nD : , if you're going to buy t_v_ company'll have that you're going to choose from , company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs .\nD : we were coming up with one product .\nB : but will will personally won't give it beyond three .\nD : no , your opinion , i'm just trying to .\nB : so we can , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , .\nC : he's tough cookie .\nB : three or four ?\nB : no , it should be no , , , , we are doing very wrong thing .\nC : five or six .\nD : what are we doing ?\nA : what are we doing ?\nD : adding them up ?\nA : we're gonna average them ?\nB : , we are taking everything , and that's have taken it very wrongly .\nA : so seven fourths .\nB : three four four two six seven seven sev one pe exactly .\nA : about one point one point eight .\nB : so we can say one or two .\nB : because it is one point eight two , so we will do two .\nA : round it up to two .\nB : so where were the trends .\nA : can you explain what you want us to write there ?\nA : how it how conforms to the current trends ?\nB : again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the as fruit shape .\nD : going on the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , would give it , , because it's hard to make fruit good to look at , that that looks , , so would actually give it three .\nD : tha three or four , i'm not .\nD : go for three .\nA : as far as the technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism .\nA : so give it four .\nA : i'd give it kinda middle of the road for for technology .\nC : am pret just the fruit does me in , it might it might be trendy to some , but i'm just not swallowing the fruit , so also would have liked to have seen the screen in it .\nC : so i'd say about four as .\nB : personally wi that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them .\nB : so and in this way our product is good .\nB : and the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy .\nB : so that is also ef that also our product meets the the fashion trends of the market .\nB : it is cus spongy also .\nB : so they can play with it , it's quite good .\nB : so then , give it two .\nB : so four five ten thirteen thirteen .\nB : so we can is it fine ?\nB : so what about company strategy ?\nD : the company strategy , .\nD : there was lot of discussing , that was good .\nD : feel got my say .\nD : so i'd give the company strategy two .\nA : it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy .\nA : is that the question ?\nD : so one or two .\nD : just leave it , it's fine .\nA : i'll go with two .\nB : so what about you , brian ?\nC : kept to the company strategy , so would go for one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by , groovy .\nB : and me also , like , this product me me me this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe .\nB : so since our product meets all these requirements , so would also prefer to give it rank one .\nB : so four six six half .\nA : so one and half .\nB : so we can say two or one .\nB : so seven seven .\nB : overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two .\nB : so overall evaluation of our product is quite good .\nB : so we can launch it .\nC : in which case we are done .\nC : 'cause we've evaluated and we are within budget .\nC : champagne lunch anyone ?"], ["<t> The project manager opens the meeting by going over the agenda. </t>  <t> She explains the project,

the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you .\nD : didn't receive it yet .\nC : anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already .\nC : then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more .\nC : then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there .\nC : then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .\nC : and then that's it .\nC : so we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nC : so any any questions ?\nC : is not at this point .\nD : not at this point .\nC : so this is our project .\nC : what we're aiming to do is to create new remote control for television .\nC : we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .\nC : the method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such .\nC : there's the functional design of the the remote control .\nC : we're going the way we'll do that is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .\nC : similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together .\nC : and then the detailed design will come after that .\nC : we'll pull it all together .\nA : i'm bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?\nA : is it just more detail , as understand it ?\nC : it we're talking the the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that thing .\nA : how how it will be done .\nA : so whe where do we identify the components of our product ?\nA : it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nC : we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then .\nC : so that's just brief overview of the the the project itself .\nC : what i'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nC : so each person in turn , i'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project .\nB : why are you looking at me ?\nC : would you like to go first ?\nB : do have choice ?\nB : things falling everywhere .\nC : , put them in pockets .\nC : you don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nB : so , my name's cat and i'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so .\nC : it's got no eyes .\nB : the eyes always ruin it .\nB : what do it's eyes like ?\nB : this is rabbit .\nC : it might be cat .\nD : origi at first it was going to be cat .\nB : don't t's furry enough , so we'll make it fluffy rabbit .\nD : now now understand now , .\nC : see by the ears .\nB : , it's fluffy rabbit , blue .\nB : rabbits don't come in blue but .\nB : and like it because it's small and it's fluffy .\nB : and one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nC : excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?\nB : am the need my notebook , top banana .\nB : , am the marketing expert so like i'm gonna be doing the according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user requirements specification of the functional design , trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design so .\nC : and more about yourself , you're from ?\nB : i'm from leicester , second year .\nB : what else do you want to know ?\nB : like sports , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning and not with rabbits , no no .\nC : but not with rabbits .\nB : and vets , like vets as .\nB : and and like cocktails , especially pink ones .\nC : excellent , to match the rabbit .\nD : so my name is maarika .\nD : where's the pen ?\nC : there's an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .\nD : , or make it smaller .\nD : so i'm the interface designer in this project and my favourite animal , i'm not so because i'm not so so very familiar with all kinds of animals , but do like dogs .\nD : , should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but .\nD : there are different kinds of dogs , but .\nA : that's not bad .\nC : it looks like dog .\nB : is bit more impressive than my rabbit .\nB : it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .\nD : it has some colourful patches , .\nD : and do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal .\nC : the other legs are on the other side .\nD : that's compared to some other animals like cats .\nD : they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .\nD : the fact that they protect their home as , .\nD : what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .\nD : hope to be loyal to the project and not to not to let people doing similar projects know the details of our project , .\nC : and where where are you from ?\nD : i'm from estonia , .\nD : so is there anything else you'd like to know ?\nD : , my roles , so in the different stages of the design , so at first will be responsible for for , designing the technical functions of the of the remote control then in the in the conceptual design stage need to come up with interface concept and then in the last stage will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .\nA : i'll do some i'll rub the features and let the drawing stay .\nA : my name is gaurav .\nA : my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is cow .\nA : i've got no idea how to draw cow .\nA : this is going to be , that'll do .\nB : they're not just like big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns .\nA : so let let me draw the body first .\nA : big , round body , really skinny legs and they've got long tail and long face .\nB : it looks like eeyore .\nA : and there is some grass there .\nA : so this is what like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , they do not disturb anybody they're buddhist in way .\nB : horns , draw some horns .\nA : so , like cows .\nA : my my role in the project is the industrial designer , so i'm supposed to design all the details of of the product ho how it works and whatever it'll take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it during the conceptual design , what are the various components of it and finally , i'm not too what was the last part .\nA : the detailed design , it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .\nA : i'm from india .\nA : i'm doing my p_h_d_ in psycholinguistics , sit at the department of psychology .\nC : now now it's my turn .\nA : that doesn't look like cow , does it ?\nD : it looks very very cute .\nC : like the cow .\nC : like dogs too , but 't do that already because 't draw dog as as you can .\nB : is that lizard ?\nB : is there difference ?\nD : is ar are they also like lizards or are they , they are .\nC : they're , they're it's lizard .\nC : and like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where was living in cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .\nD : hope you don't like snakes , do you ?\nC : don't like snakes .\nC : come from australia and we have nasty snakes .\nC : that's where i'm from , australia .\nC : i'm from melbourne and i'm your project manager for today and my role is to keep things going and make that you all work together in productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with product .\nC : so , let's see what's next in the powerpoint presentation .\nC : so , i've just thought i've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go .\nB : if you click on it you can , was looking at the website , and the other things that they've made and like put down some like inspirational words like that got from looking at the pictures .\nC : so this is the overall budget for our project .\nC : we've got we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .\nC : we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each .\nC : and with that we're aiming for profit of fifty million euros .\nC : and that's selling them on the international market , not just in the u_k_ .\nC : so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and half euro so that we can reach that profit target .\nC : so that's something to keep in mind while you're designing .\nC : this is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing , .\nC : we've only got couple of minutes .\nC : does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nD : i'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nC : that's probably something that it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary .\nA : in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be trendy , user friendly and original so your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nC : something something new .\nB : so the motto is we put the fashion in electronics and so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , ?\nB : so i'm thinking , like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and like that .\nB : so something heading towards that , so it's not overly what most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so figure how many do you need , ?\nC : so perhaps some menu-based thing , or .\nB : something that's little less crowded than this , like , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t_v_ , ?\nB : but what do most people do ?\nB : they turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , , and then they turn it off again .\nA : there is lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , but will be used ten percent of the time , .\nB : sometimes they play movie .\nB : so there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , to do .\nC : so , no .\nC : it could be one button for menu , if you really need to go and do that .\nA : and then use the .\nB : so , if you're the sad case that knows how your remote control works , then that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them .\nB : 'cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and if you can put it up on the thing but it is just like long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nC : haven't had look yet , .\nC : any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nA : we can aim for we can think about all these little things , but we can aim wi that gives high battery life , although don't think that it's huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , every now and then you need to replace the batteries .\nD : but even though it has to be re original we shouldn't go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have lot of problems with learning , , .\nA : big learning curve , .\nA : so , it should fit in as , and the stereotype of .\nC : it's like those fancy websites that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were .\nC : so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .\nC : we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im you're looking at the working design , you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , like you said at the start .\nC : i'll see you in half an hour .\nC : carry the laptops back again .\nC : do we need to unplug things ?"], ["<t> The project manager opens

hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .\nC : the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder .\nC : if that meant that you could see it or not .\nC : i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder .\nC : and it should be in there .\nD : wi on on what ?\nD : project project documents , , , , .\nC : project documents , .\nC : so i'll put it in there .\nC : is it best if send you an email , to let it's there ?\nD : yes , so .\nC : i'll do that next time .\nC : i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting .\nC : the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one .\nC : then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us .\nC : sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .\nD : the last minute , , .\nC : and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control .\nC : and we've got forty minutes to do that in .\nC : so would say ?\nA : you said targ target groups , what does that mean ?\nC : as who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , .\nC : so we need to , we need to have fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions of the dem remote control itself .\nC : so with that it's best if hand over to you .\nC : does anyone have preference for going first ?\nA : go first , .\nC : you wanna go first ?\nC : so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .\nC : assume we just pull it out ?\nA : so from the .\nC : just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ?\nC : once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that don't have to scribble everything down .\nD : , afterwards , , .\nA : so with with regard to the working design of this remote control i've identified few basic components of the remote and se from the design , functional design perspective we can now know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .\nA : so this is the method that i'll mostly be following in my in my role .\nA : the identification of the components , and since since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects , would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person .\nA : we'll then integrate this into the product design at technical level and update and come up with new design , so it's cyclical process .\nA : so these were the basic findings from today .\nA : the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email .\nA : quickly jotted them down .\nA : so the as told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other .\nA : so the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .\nA : also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex .\nA : and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television .\nA : how however , our our remote control would only be dealing with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .\nA : also the management wants that our design should be unique it so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard .\nA : so he he here is functional overview of the remote control .\nA : there's an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface .\nA : the user interf interface communicates with the chip , so i'll basic go over to the .\nA : so if if this is our energy source and this is cell , it communicates it feeds energy into the into the chip , which finds out how how to do everything .\nA : there is user interface here .\nA : so whe when the user presses button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which has an infrared receiver .\nA : the there can be bulb here to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating .\nA : so these are the essent so all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , make the chip more complicated and bigger , .\nA : so in my personal preferences i'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible .\nA : this would help us to upgrade our technology at future point of time .\nA : and also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design , so that our remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most televisions .\nA : that's about it .\nA : so anything that you would like to know or no , don't have any idea about what each component costs .\nC : do you have any idea about costs at this point ?\nC : 'cause that's something to consider , , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .\nA : so so tha , we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but unfortunately do not have any data , so identified the functional components for that .\nC : are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?\nD : we need like some general discussion at the end probably .\nC : that will do .\nC : so do you want to yes , shall shall we pull this up ?\nD : since since we were discussing some design issues then would like to continue , .\nC : that has to come out of there .\nC : those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst .\nD : should it just there's just nothing .\nA : it'll take some time .\nC : it ta takes little , and have you you need to then also press on yours , function eight , so the blue function key at the bottom and eight .\nD : nothin , something is coming up .\nA : there it is , .\nC : now it's coming , computer no signal .\nA : it'll come up , it no signal .\nA : it says something now , adjusting .\nD : my my computer went blank now .\nD : but don't see anything don't see anything on my computer now .\nC : there we go , there we go .\nD : this is the problem , but .\nC : if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both .\nA : and one more time .\nC : so one more time .\nC : should just for moment , adjusting .\nD : that's fine , that's good .\nD : let's start from the beginning .\nD : so i'm going to speak about technical functions design just like some some first issues that came up .\nD : so the method was adopting at this point , it's not for the for the whole period of the all the project but it's just at at this very moment .\nD : my method was to look at other remote controls , so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what functionality they used .\nD : and then after having got this inspiration and having compared what found on the web just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what what the user might desire as additional functionalities .\nD : and , and then just to put the main function of the remote control in in words .\nD : so the findings were that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward .\nD : and some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , then the user would like to switch the channel just changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .\nD : and and also the volume is very important .\nA : cou could you go back for second ?\nA : switching on off channel , volume , , that's .\nD : among the findings found that most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design , like operating v_c_r_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with d_v_d_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .\nD : so my personal preferences would be to keep the the whole remote control small just like the physical size .\nD : and then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and the colour tends to be red .\nD : then , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then the one thows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there .\nD : but then other functionalities could be just there could be menu button and you could change things on the screen then , brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu .\nD : and , the last question had about whether we wanted to incorporate more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update .\nD : so at the for the time being that's that's all .\nD : if you have questions , and also it's it's other question is because there are so many different and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d_v_d_ there are the video c_d_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .\nC : if that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had decent case for that we really t's important to include video and d_v_d_ , could get back to them and see .\nC : it's it's just whether it's worth arguing about .\nC : are there any questions for clarification of maarika before we go on to the next one ?\nA : so in the user interface requirements we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .\nA : but so so at this stage , how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or in we can completely do away with buttons and have some fancy user interface like that .\nA : but is is there any any thoughts on that ?\nD : the buttons are still the most easy for the user to use , what other options would you have ?\nD : little screen , but this would be really lot of learning for the user and and the user just wants to get get result quickly , not to spend time in like giving several orders .\nA : and it'll make the costs .\nD : would would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other proposals .\nA : the co costs will also play big role when we come to know about them .\nA : so can probably until we have more knowledge on that .\nA : if the if the costs allow , we can have like an display and with because we do want something fancy and fashionable as .\nC : we can discuss that after the next one .\nC : do you want to .\nB : do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?\nD : am going in the direction ?\nD : here it comes .\nC : i'm getting hungry .\nD : here you are .\nB : that's why it won't meet .\nC : we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .\nA : try to press , , .\nC : is it plugged in prop it's working ?\nB : so what have , wh where i've got my information from is survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with hundred subjects and then they gave them questionnaire .\nB : so it was all about , , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , .\nB : what's the most annoying things about remote controls and the possibility of speech recognition and screens in remote control .\nB : not that they actually gave me any answers on the screens , so should have taken that bit out , but anyway .\nB : what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so , definitely you should be looking at something quite different .\nB : seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .\nB : the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense .\nB : eighty percent of users would spend more to get , looking remote control .\nB : current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour , as you'll see on the next slide .\nB : what zapping is , but , .\nC : it's switching between channels , randomly going through .\nB : but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on .\nB : fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , , we were saying earlier about , , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly .\nB : so this is my little graph thing .\nC : that's bit difficult to see .\nB : , send it to all of you .\nC : if you explain it to us it'll be fine .\nB : what it is is it's cones , 'cause they'd be more exciting .\nB : but where's it go ?\nC : liked the , liked the litt come back .\nB : i'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing .\nB : so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection .\nB : what you can't see is volume selection , it's little bit higher than all the others .\nC : that's the next one along , ?\nB : so what the graph shows is that , , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like their importance , , so on scale of one to ten , how important is that and , , channel selection and volume selection are essential , and the power , t's not quite so essential , , although don't understand how it couldn't be , and everything else , , , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used .\nB : this is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .\nB : so , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls .\nB : that they get lost , that the , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury .\nB : if you're watching enough t_v_ to get repetitive strain injury from , watching t_v_ , then that's the least of your problems , but , it's up there .\nC : the remote control .\nB : so the the r_s_i_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and , not straining your wrists watching t_v_ .\nB : this is pink because was copying and pasting the table , and didn't have time to white it out again .\nB : but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software .\nB : so you can see from that that , , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite lot more quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it .\nB : so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but do wonder how that would work given that t_v_ , , tends to be people talking and , , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t_v_ .\nB : so these are my personal preferences .\nB : so you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , , so something that's , , bit .\nB : functional , so it's useful , but minimalist .\nB : there's there's an important thing that , , people use when , , when you're filling up your home , , lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , , , and you've got all this , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ?\nB : so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so we need to aim for both .\nB : then long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and , , was thinking that solar power would be quite because , , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment bit .\nB : and then like locator , so , like you have for mobile phone or not mobile phone , that's it , .\nA : some ring , some .\nC : keys and things like that , .\nC : whistle and it screams at you , .\nB : know , it's weird .\nB : my flatmate and were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and was like need to get one for everything .\nB : so , so something where you clap and then it beeps , something sound that you don't often hear on the t_v_ , , 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window .\nC : that's you , excellent .\nD : that's very good , very interesting .\nC : i'm just gonna tick yes .\nC : so , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss .\nA : one of the very interesting things that came up in ka kate cat cat's presentation was this this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people .\nA : so if we need to have target group then as far as the motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and , good looking we are better off targeting younger audience then , people who are comparatively elderly .\nB : that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , , whether , , these are the people that will pay more for more stylish remote control , but i'm assuming , , yes .\nA : bu but but the survey did say that things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then it'll certainly be more popular with this ye with the younger people as compared to older people , .\nC : then again the where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the how often they're buying televisions .\nB : that's when you go to uni , isn't it ?\nC : but you don't have much money , generally .\nD : you share television that .\nC : would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their toys and it's on , we unplugged it .\nA : but still , if if you can go back to that slide and , how popular was it ?\nB : i've unplugged it .\nB : do you want me to .\nC : here , let me .\nA : that's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them .\nB : seventy six point three percent .\nD : it was seventy something , , .\nA : so even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ?\nB : kn you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but it has been proven that that people of that age group have higher disposable income because they don't have like , , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , but you don't have mortgage , you don't have life insurance policy , you don't normally have car , , so .\nC : they've got no commitments and usually not car and all of those things .\nB : you're still learning to drive actually , so that just costs more than car , but .\nA : so you're more likely to .\nB : so like it is an age group to target , really , .\nC : and if we're if we're talking twenty five euros as price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people .\nB : no , that's what , that's like fifteen pounds ?\nB : , many people without t_v_ .\nD : this this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have t_v_ to use its full .\nC : but do they but the t_v_s are often someone's old t_v_ that's blah blah and be bit strange to have fancy rome remote .\nB : we didn't have t_v_ last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , .\nD : common , the students , .\nD : the the stu , and the remote control might not , it might not even function with the old t_v_ .\nB : 've we've got quite decent t_v_ .\nA : bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , ?\nA : so are are are .\nD : or we can just , but at the same time we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually they're all still re young people .\nB : the fact that , , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , would pay more for voice recognition remote control , does say quite lot really .\nB : so that and the disposable income and don't t's something to ignore , .\nB : is not massive difference , .\nC : if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition .\nB : no , do .\nC : is that gonna have an implication for the technical specs ?\nA : was having general outlook on most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself i'm not very about , because one of the things that cat pointed out was how do we go about implementing it ?\nB : you do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ?\nB : because you have like every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them .\nA : but how frequently do we use it anyway and ho how good is it , voice recognition softwares are still quite .\nC : with but with t_v_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , louder , tha that should be relatively simple .\nB : so you'd need code word .\nB : so like when you say change , except that's being said quite lot on t_v_ , so like , , remote .\nB : how often do people say remote on t_v_ ?\nB : although only watch charmed , so really wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five , , remote ten , remote one two nine .\nA : so it seems like feasible thing to implement for for limited .\nC : but if you wanna look into that just to just to check .\nC : so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then we're going to get anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising .\nD : but , , , .\nB : don't think there's lot of voice recognition remote controls .\nD : now the the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's it's safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .\nC : we need both .\nA : what wh what was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on t_v_ and how they are numbered on the remote control .\nA : if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that person can say , want to watch i_t_v_ one instead of saying that want to go onto channel number forty five .\nB : that would be another way to do it .\nA : so if if something like that can be incorporated , some .\nC : so that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be .\nB : but then the code word would be even more important , because sky advertise on every channel , don't they , , so then it would be you'd be watching charmed , and then the sky advert would come on and it would change to sky .\nC : watch sky and .\nB : , and that would be really annoying .\nC : but that's definitely possibility .\nD : but but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just speak into it and and the t_v_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .\nB : do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on remote control though ?\nC : so that you can yell at it , .\nB : , so you have to have the remote control .\nB : it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , .\nD : but then the remote control the idea is it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep near yourself .\nB : , suppose nearer to you but like if you have surround sound then .\nA : and it might become very difficult from distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl it'll it'll .\nD : no , but was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , and not to yell at it from the distance .\nA : so wh another thing that can be used is that there can be beeper button on the t_v_ , so you can go and press that button and and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is .\nC : that's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but you could have something , but if it was something that you could like stick onto the t_v_ , some like two if you bought it in two part pack , so one part attaches to the t_v_ .\nB : 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .\nC : the , but it solves the problem of having different noises .\nC : we're gonna have to wrap this up .\nC : but if we go away with that that general specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option but that needs little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning .\nD : the major ones , .\nC : what we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some summarisation , which you'll get immediately by email .\nC : send me your presentations so that use them to make the minutes , and then we've got lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\nC : i'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but i'll send you an email when do it , so that .\nA : so where exactly is this , .\nC : it should be on your desktop , so on the .\nC : so i'll put it i'll put them there as soon as i've written them .\nD : did you find it ?\nD : it's just , .\nA : in that one , .\nC : and email them round .\nB : so you want our powerpoint presentations in there , ?\nC : that would be .\nD : so so we'll just put them there , we we , we won't even .\nC : put them in there .\nC : then you don't have to email them .\nB : there you go .\nB : but is everyone's called functional requirements ?\nC : no , they're all called something slightly different .\nC : technical requirements and something something , .\nB : so that's good .\nB : that's me done .\nC : so , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .\nC : as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\nC : whatever that means .\nA : i'll find out .\nC : you'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map that we'll keep keep our options op ?\nD : something conceptual , .\nA : wha what was it again that was supposed to look into ?\nA : con components , .\nD : but the next meeting are we going to have it after lunch or shall we prepare our to prepare , , , that's good .\nC : no , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , so that's fine , before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some summary .\nC : so you can we'll see you for lunch in sec ?"], ["<t> The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. </t>  <t> The industrial designer begins presenting, first

project documents .\nC : if you got chance to just have look at it .\nC : anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to .\nC : and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching .\nC : do you wanna start again ?\nC : let me we've got forty minutes .\nA : so haven't made powerpoint presentation , , i'll use the whiteboard instead .\nC : you haven't made powerpoint , .\nA : , so i'll start off by i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are or highlighting or underlining them like that .\nC : let's hope the pen holds out .\nA : so i'll start again with brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of remote control and then we can probably discuss the various components .\nA : so what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote , ?\nA : if you open it , you have circuit board here , , and this is the chip that was talking about last time .\nA : this sends information to tr transistor here , which then sends the information to an l_e_d_ device here .\nA : if you flip the printed circuit board , and this is the most important point here , everything else is , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like .\nA : so you see particular button attaches to particular place on the p_c_b_ and on pressing this button circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there .\nA : so the important point that read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so we can have configuration irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have .\nA : so that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have .\nA : so the batteries , i'll start with the battery , ?\nA : so they can be simple which is like the normal batteries in our the cells , ?\nA : thes these are the kind different batteries that the company makes , ?\nB : does that mean like wind-up one ?\nA : so if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so they'll they'll since they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas cheaper , all these options .\nA : so the third one is the kinetic energy ones .\nB : you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching t_v_ .\nC : and charging their remote , .\nB : and stop worrying about the whole r_s_i_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just yay .\nA : it's good option .\nD : so what was what was this ka .\nA : the the kinetic energy one is that they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .\nA : but if it is good idea for remote control , because it'll just lie there for long while sometimes .\nC : for remote , 'cause you .\nA : but as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it re recharges .\nA : and the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company .\nA : so i'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from everybody's perspective .\nA : there are different cases that can be provided .\nA : they can be the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with one-sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides .\nA : these are the three options , ?\nA : would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever there were different supplements available , like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , ?\nD : you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , , .\nB : did you say wool ?\nC : wood , wood .\nB : you'll understand why when we get to my presenta .\nA : the so we can use even certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment , so it's it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but it cannot be used on double curved surface .\nA : if we choose this , we cannot use titanium .\nA : for for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic .\nA : the interface options now .\nA : so we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons .\nA : we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers , , something like that .\nB : sony ericsson mobile phones has it .\nA : so , and they have they can even have an an integrated push-button inside the scrolling thing .\nA : the scroll plus push .\nA : so this is something that has been recently developed by the company , in the last decade , so not too recent .\nA : and l_c_d_s , we can have l_c_d_s .\nA : so these two are recent and and this is quite old .\nA : the various electronic options are so this concerns firs first of all the the chips showed you at so there's there's chip behind this one , ?\nA : the p_c_b_ is inexpensive , so we can put put in whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either simple one or regular or advanced .\nA : and the price goes up as we go down , .\nA : so the good thing about wh wh why why we would want to use advanced why we might want to use advanced is that l_c_d_s can only come with the advanced chip .\nA : the we need regular or advanced for scroll wheels .\nA : and the chip includes the infra infrared sender .\nA : besides this in electr under electronics also the company has started making sample sender , which is did not explained what what it was , but i'm guessing that so they have sample sender and sample speaker .\nA : so i'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like , as soon as you press button , it it give gives you feedback , one five or whatever .\nA : and whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway .\nA : so , these are the different options that we have .\nA : so that's that's now now that we can integrate , the user interface and the marketing things in that , keep taking out things from this and underlining things that are important , .\nC : do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up .\nC : what are you , powerpoint , or .\nD : have some powerpoint , .\nC : do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ?\nB : no it's got its little camera in there , plug it in .\nA : it should should do it .\nD : to be honest actually , mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk this time , mentioned them already in the previous talk .\nD : so , this time might not have them on the slides but just mention them aw again .\nD : so would also include the definition of user interface so it's the aspects of of of computer system or programme which can be seen by the user and and which the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data .\nD : so this would includes things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as , and colour , and so on .\nD : the method employed this time was again having look to related products and mainly on the internet and then analyse them from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also whether their appearance was was pleasant .\nD : and then this this this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .\nD : so some findings .\nD : so in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you you really want to use and and it's just confusing , it takes know time to learn .\nD : and would just quickly show some of them that found .\nD : some of them are here .\nD : the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , , for that .\nD : 's go back .\nD : so , they're quite big and have many many buttons .\nD : actually of the of all these personally prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least with the smallest number of buttons as .\nD : and would say even the appearance of some of them is not so .\nD : so let's carry on with this .\nD : so other findings some new things used , some of them were mentioned already by our technical designer .\nD : our own company has developed new in user interface , no this is not the one .\nD : there is we can include voice recognition and it allows it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it .\nD : so this this one was already mentioned the l_c_ display .\nD : another new development is scroll button , which was also also already mentioned .\nD : and our own manufacturing division ha has designed new programmable speech speaker unit it's it should be .\nD : and this means that once it it it comes together with voice recognition , but it's once once the gadget recognises the voice of the speaker , there can be pre-programmed answer , , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever .\nD : so this is also one of the dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .\nA : can you go back for second ?\nA : are you wha what this means , spinning wheel with the l_c_ display ?\nA : are , the ipod thing , .\nC : it's like the like you said , no ?\nC : the scroll scroll wheel .\nB : you can't , it's like the ipod .\nD : no no , the scroll button is different thing .\nD : have picture if you just moment , i'll i'll show you .\nD : wasn't completely myself , but it's just like it's it's wheel , it's like not separate buttons .\nD : look , this one here .\nD : but i'm i'm not really whether whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or this or .\nB : no , you can .\nA : it's the ipod alright , .\nB : it's like it's like where you how you have your your mouse , and you go round and it's like that and you spin round and it .\nA : so instead of going down you just spin , .\nB : it is you just go round and it is bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast .\nB : like the the wheels that click on the side you you get much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite lot of .\nB : do , if you're lookin if you're scrolling through the to of your music and you're looking at t_ , then it's lot faster than the wheel , but you've got lot less control over it .\nA : so should include that here as , l_c_d_s plus spinning .\nD : and the personal preferences are the same as as as last time .\nD : it it has to be small , simple .\nD : we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard major buttons like on , off , ch the channels and and then volume and then the rest would be menu on the screen .\nD : and also thought if we want to keep it small and and actually quite like the idea of scroll scrolling button , it could be for for voice like , , it like on like it used to be on walkmans .\nD : there is there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control .\nD : so , that's that's it .\nC : straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .\nB : i've put the copy of the presentation in the .\nC : the project documents .\nC : if you two could both do that as , in case we need to refer to it .\nC : here it comes .\nB : so what did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future .\nB : now , the first aspect is twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third aspect .\nB : so , the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which given the target group is what you would expect , really .\nB : , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the l_c_d_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for .\nB : and , it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel .\nA : so as you're discussing things , is it if we just keep highlighting things here ?\nA : so so it , so probably voice recognition is is important , ?\nC : that's over on the interface , if if you could put .\nC : and the and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing .\nA : have point about , if it is the point to take it up .\nA : l_c_d_s are for feedback , , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an on the remote ?\nB : depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ?\nB : we've got one of those telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you and then it goes to the t_v_ and then you , and then it comes , so it actually takes quite long time .\nB : and if you get the number in wrong , then it's bit of pain , so , , screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that .\nB : but like remotes do tend to get thrown about bit .\nC : it it is also quite though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , so if you're watching something .\nA : that's true , , that's also .\nB : and it would be like if you could make it integrate with the t_v_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than .\nC : rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure .\nB : but way to do it would be similar way to how you have your mobile phone , , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched .\nB : so you can have like what looks like normal remote control , or like minimalist remote control .\nB : so you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , .\nC : and then you can flip it open .\nA : so now we seem to have consensus that l_c_d_s are definitely the way to go because of style and .\nB : so that decides your whole chip thing .\nA : you you agree ?\nA : so l_c_d_s , , definitely .\nB : , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration .\nB : discovered clip art .\nB : so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture .\nB : so , i'm taking this to mean , , curviness .\nB : 'cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables .\nC : and possibly even uneven , like not not symmet .\nB : bit of asymmetry and .\nB : but that would be good way to to get in the whole r_s_i_ issue in there , because if you think most people use the remote control with their hand ha hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the hand .\nB : i'm not quite about the relevance of material will be spongy .\nB : but you have to suppose you wouldn't get remote an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber .\nC : something bit squishy and , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as .\nA : we we have we have rubber , but there is problem that forgot to discuss with the with using so if if we use latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , so we could use titanium , wood or plastic or , energy source .\nD : so it could be like rubbery , .\nC : to some degree .\nC : or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other power things .\nB : if it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down .\nC : from from bouncing it .\nA : tap it on the desk , .\nC : you can have it as like little ball to bounce , that flips open .\nA : so probably double curved surface is the way to go , , .\nA : or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because i'm not if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera .\nB : you have to have certain element of flatness , .\nB : it it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , , it's like how you put your hands so it's the least movement .\nA : singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ?\nB : no , don't makes lot of difference .\nB : have one of those slidey phones and the back is essentially straight , but it's curvy , so .\nB : besides , you have four sides to thing , so does curved one side mean one side is straight and , curved two sides means the whole thing is just big curvy thing ?\nA : di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding because according to the information that have , the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three .\nA : eith either we have flat surfaced case or curved surfaced case .\nA : it does not say anything about whether technically , , this this is available .\nC : nothing to open them .\nB : it's it's more about the protecting the , which is where it came from .\nB : but no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause had nothing better to do with my time .\nC : what've we got ?\nB : combine style with level of functionality , beauty and practicality and thing of beauty and function .\nC : looking at what we've got , we we want an display with spinning wheel .\nA : let's let's try to rub off things and , so hand dynamos are definitely out , ?\nC : rub off some of those .\nA : you you got wind dynamo , .\nC : it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having having wind up .\nA : kinetic energy does seem to have some appeal , but it's .\nC : tha depends how much how much movement it really needs .\nB : it's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ?\nA : as against watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .\nB : if 't imagine wooden remote control .\nA : kinetic energy it needs don't have too much technical information on that , , .\nC : pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it .\nA : let's keep it option keep an option , .\nC : i'd i'd keep it on .\nA : the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , ?\nC : we don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable .\nA : it has to be at least curved from one side , .\nA : we still have all all the options .\nA : wood , do you think wood will be good idea ?\nD : wood is 't how do you you can't keep it really small you can't make it like thin and the wood thing .\nD : because you need to you you need to put all the technology in , so if the case you add the case and it it becomes bit bulky wi .\nA : if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , it's it's much more .\nC : and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , ha would think rubber or plastic is more .\nD : wood is not really .\nB : t's not very cleanable either , do .\nB : it's it's not practical it's it's alright for table , but for remote control , .\nB : and splinters and and it just doesn't make any sense , is the thing with wood .\nA : wood is out .\nD : , in the case of remote control not really .\nA : now for the really interesting , the interface .\nA : so the the push-buttons is is our expertise in the industry , but it seems to be out of trend , , nobody seems to be .\nB : you have to have some push-buttons , don't you ?\nD : but you for for the channel numb channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ?\nD : so for channel numbers but but but the display is , it's faster with and if we dis and when we discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then you can use it as normal remote control , but if you do want to use , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming .\nA : if if we have displays , that opens up whole world , , if you have an display , then you can select almost everything on the display .\nC : just for fast .\nB : this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that made , where , , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven .\nC : and it l_ .\nA : so in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options .\nA : do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ?\nA : or do we have just channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ?\nD : no , no , we we definitely need the the numbers , because it's otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels .\nC : do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as ?\nD : would say buttons , because it's .\nA : or on the we can , .\nB : would think buttons , .\nB : it's it's the the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their t_v_ and put on channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , , change the contrast on their t_v_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , , most of the time there's limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the t_v_ , is the the the issue there .\nA : so buttons definitely in but shall we try to draw prec .\nC : that's what you are gonna do next , so if we put down the key things that we want .\nA : , so the components .\nA : so what about the the scrolling ?\nD : but i'm not completely completely clear , about the spinning wheel .\nD : so it it doesn't make sense to have both like scrolling and spinning thing , it's you can al include everything in the spinning if you , , in that case .\nC : just spinning and not scrolling , would say .\nB : would say the the the spinning goes at high speed to to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you , you want to be going so fast or not .\nB : but the the thing with this whole if you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then i'm not how scrolling wheel would work .\nA : i'm not it'll be good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber .\nC : but if you've got if if you've got flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half .\nD : but you can , so too , the case would be the case would be rubber and the the buttons , rubber buttons , but then .\nB : but your spinning wheel tends to go to one side .\nC : that would be on one side , .\nA : it or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber like that .\nC : no , it's just the casing rubber on the outside .\nB : you want an outside of rubber and then open it up and or like interchangeable cases .\nA : everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .\nB : 'cause know like we're going back to ipods again the whole spinning wheel , but have like , my ipod's not made of rubber , but then have little rubber case that goes over the top of it and change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .\nA : , so so that gives us more trendy look as .\nB : the spinning wheel is definitely very now .\nA : and we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , ?\nC : that's what they're after .\nA : so i'll rub that out .\nA : and colours can be provided with the case rather than but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , , just keep it black , or .\nD : we it was requirement that we use our the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black , or , does .\nB : that doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .\nD : banana's yellow , , definitely .\nB : but do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do ?\nB : so you could have like suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .\nA : if you go over to the integrated circuits .\nA : since we're having l_c_d_s there there's no way that we're will be able to what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since l_c_d_s seems to be definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend .\nC : we need the advanced .\nA : so i'll rub off the other two .\nB : so are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or if solar panels with the rubber .\nC : that was the we can't have solar panels with rubber , so .\nA : is the constraint was .\nA : so we'll have using the simple battery will be safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , , although it does seem interesting .\nB : , so we lose that .\nC : shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think on as our case , and then .\nD : and the buttons as , .\nC : we've got five more minutes .\nA : but it does not hold any advantages as such for .\nB : it's just gimmick .\nA : so we understand this better now that the the speaker is for the feedback , ?\nA : it it says the things that you type in like that , so ye , we we don't have too much information about it , , , so so this is in as then , the sample speaker .\nC : if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then i'd put them in , but if it's .\nD : but it it it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , .\nC : it's from the company , so .\nC : and the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .\nA : flat on the top .\nC : can pull the thing out the back of your computer ?\nB : , do you want me to what does i_c_s_ mean ?\nC : just so we can nothing , it's , i'm just there we go .\nB : so it's advanced integrated circuits ?\nC : now i've gone too far .\nA : we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as as l_c_d_s , .\nC : we're on our way .\nC : so we've worked out that we're going with simple battery , the advanced chip and curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber .\nC : we're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition .\nC : that's our overall concept , and it's gonna look vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours .\nD : so would with have the spinning wheel inside with the , or would it be on the outer .\nC : it's on the .\nB : imagine it would be inside .\nB : so actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got screen and spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .\nB : so you've still not got like lot of in the you've got , like if you're modelling on ipod you've got five buttons and wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , .\nC : in the centre , , .\nC : so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting .\nC : in the meantime , the industrial designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , which i'll presume he'll work out what that means .\nC : the user interface designer will work on the user interface design and the marketing expert is going to work on product evaluation .\nC : and as as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .\nC : and anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it .\nB : i'm gonna go and sit on my own .\nC : nobody wants to talk to you .\nB : know , i'm hated .\nB : i've got bit tangled up in all this ."], ["<t> The project manager opens this detailed design meeting by going over the agenda. </t>  <t> The designers present the prototype, which they decided to make the color and shape of a banana. </t>  <t> They demonstrate the remote components, showing how it flips open on the side and features a LCD and scroll inside. </t>  <t> The marketing expert gives the product evaluation, which is based on the criteria of attractiveness, whether it matches operation behavior of the user, locatability, intuitiveness, ergonomic design, and how technologically innovative it is. </t>  <t> They rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. </t>  <t> The group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget. </t>  <t> They have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel inside. </t>  <t> The team discusses the

.\nC : i'll take minutes .\nC : the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\nC : then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\nB : it does look very .\nC : then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .\nC : and then we'll be making that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits .\nC : and then we will have brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .\nC : so we've got forty minutes .\nB : and then do we get to make remote control ?\nC : 'cause we missed out .\nC : so it's now that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .\nA : how how much do we have , forty minutes ?\nD : about four fifteen , .\nC : until about four fifteen .\nC : go for it .\nC : do you want yes .\nD : so , you said are are we starting with the the so will you start with like the the shape and things and and then will explain the the user interface things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and , but it's it's just an approximation .\nA : so going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\nB : you think bananas are safe thing to use ?\nB : it's bit phallic .\nC : dual use , perfect .\nC : dual use , perfect .\nB : your remote control ?\nB : that's just bad .\nC : does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?\nA : so it's the it's the flip open thing again .\nA : so now we we have the , so ma maarika will explain you the user interface there .\nA : and it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .\nA : and we have the user interface in here and the the and and the scroll are inside .\nA : everything else is probably user interface , so .\nC : and it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that .\nA : it has , .\nB : is it to scale , or do you think you can make it bit smaller ?\nD : it could be made bit smaller , and and it would be and , but one thing we actually forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , .\nA : , but since it's made of rubber anyway .\nB : it does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so would say that this curvy does look quite like vegetable .\nD : and it's spongy as .\nB : wasn't very keen on that , but .\nD : so so the user interface as as we discussed last time on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things .\nD : so we have that channels here starting from one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one .\nD : so it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , zero here .\nC : six seven eight nine .\nD : and then , this is on off button .\nD : it's it's quite standard place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's user friendly .\nD : and then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one .\nD : and and we would also have little thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .\nB : so where's the volume ?\nD : the volume is is scrolling .\nD : on the side , this one .\nA : it's on the side .\nB : you did get that in then , .\nD : you just do it like this .\nD : and and and it's it's on the back is cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .\nD : so the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , , there there you have the screen and and you have the spinning wheel with options to choose .\nD : you can move back and forth and then if you need to choose something on the screen , you just push the cen the middle button .\nB : the thing we forgot was like mute button .\nA : no , we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .\nD : we'll have this on the screen , on the display .\nC : or you could have it so you on the wheel if you .\nB : on the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .\nA : on the we , the main menu will have various options .\nD : but the but the mute , the scrolling is you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , ?\nC : but if you hold it in , if it's scroll and click so you hold it in ?\nB : but it's scroll and click , isn't it ?\nB : so that that solves the whole mute issue .\nD : and , so so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .\nD : you can't really see it in the interface .\nA : it's hidden in there somewhere .\nD : and we do have the logo on it as .\nC : and it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the colours .\nD : we could do the logo in grey , as it is on the website .\nA : we ran out of resources here , so .\nD : in the actual one .\nD : so if you have questions .\nA : you can have look .\nC : very good , let's have look .\nC : test it out .\nC : it's intermediate colour , .\nB : , we hold the remote .\nB : but it it does feel all cold and slimy .\nB : hate play-do , it's just minging .\nB : but , that's , .\nC : so if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there suspect we're gonna have couple of minor finance issues , but we'll se i'm we can get around them somehow .\nA : see the budget .\nC : we'll just send all of our manufacturing to some poor country and cut some of the prices that way .\nB : so what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design .\nB : so we're gonna be using seven point scale , so one is , , yes , it meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again .\nB : what did was went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made list of them .\nB : so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying , we did manage to do that , or no , we really forgot about that .\nB : so these are what they are .\nB : yes , did have , , c_ , and d_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .\nC : so for each of these we need to give it one to seven .\nC : dots , never mind .\nB : but if you can imagine that they say , , c_ , and d_ , then that would be really good .\nA : we'll give it maximum points in everything .\nD : the , it's definitely attractive .\nD : the locatable thing we actually forgot .\nB : we'd kinda said that you'd have little thing to stick on the t_v_ ?\nC : just prepare one now .\nD : shall prepare it now ?\nD : it will be red , too .\nB : so , be attractive to look at .\nB : that's this one .\nB : what do you all say ?\nD : seven was the maximum , ?\nD : go for seven .\nC : seven , , it's terribly sexy .\nB : we're all so proud of the .\nB : so that'll be seven for .\nB : could no , you can't whilst that's up there .\nB : what i've done on the next page is i've set it up so we just put the marks in .\nC : except we can't we can if we then , i'll take note , it's fine .\nB : but that's alright .\nA : but we can we can take note the the only thing that we were considering was that this thing is more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're left scrolling with your finger .\nB : if you take note of them , and then i'll put them in in minute .\nB : so we're all agreeing on seven for ?\nB : does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?\nD : would think yes , .\nD : so so we we might do we might want to do like another model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .\nC : but that's gonna be problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in family .\nA : so bu it's it's not huge problem , because it is operatable .\nB : it's not it's not like it's pen .\nD : but then then left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just .\nB : but because it's not like it's pen , , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so would say it's not such big issue .\nD : because anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , so if the majority are right-handed , it's or six , because it's just one one one among the issues , .\nB : you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .\nB : so that does negate the whole r_s_i_ issue .\nB : so we need to put that needs little bit of investigation , give it five , would say ?\nB : what do you what do you all think ?\nC : for most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to they .\nA : one more thing is that it might be little clumsy when when it opens up , , so it opens on the side .\nD : no , , but but we have it nicely with the hinges here .\nD : so it won't be problem , it will be and it will be it won't be heavy .\nA : so you can decide wh whether .\nB : the alternative is flipping from the top .\nD : but it's it's bit long .\nA : but we which makes it really big , .\nC : the length is gonna be difficu .\nD : it's little bit long .\nB : but you were thinking about making it smaller , ?\nD : it can be opened like this and .\nA : this this makes it more and two , it might interfere with the i_r_ channel .\nB : because so you have to keep that side flat .\nD : but if we flip it open only as much as that .\nB : so it works like mobile phone flipping , but , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .\nB : are are we admitting defeat on c_ or are we saying we're gonna stick locator on the t_v_ ?\nC : no , we're gonna put it like we've got there's the locator dot .\nA : no , we have locator .\nB : so that means you need that does mean you need little speaker on it though , doesn't it ?\nD : that you stick on t_v_ .\nB : to make it beep .\nD : but but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to to do some to make some sounds , so .\nB : so that's two , so that's seven , .\nA : intuitive , completely intuitive .\nD : if if this means intuitive , if it means the way people are used to finding things and it's it's .\nC : i'd say six , 'cause the the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it .\nC : really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .\nB : and so , should we say five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do , it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first .\nC : so might be but it and it's something that they will be experiencing in lot of different places soon .\nA : and even the scroll , it's it's new technology so might be little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is not very intuitive but it's good technology , once they get used to it .\nB : so we give that one five , you think ?\nC : i'm happy with five ?\nA : i'm gonna give seven in everything , so .\nB : i'm glad you're accepting this .\nB : it has taken little while , hasn't it ?\nB : intuitive but , it's really hard to write on those .\nB : went bit mad , didn't ?\nB : would this comes back from this whole thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed .\nC : but otherwise it's superb .\nB : so , should we give it six ?\nD : the ergonom ergonomic design , the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , ?\nA : unless you are all the time sitting .\nD : so it's kinda .\nC : 've banned them from .\nA : it is ergonomic .\nB : used to send fifty texts day , , and never got repetitive strain injury from that , so find it quite hard to believe to be honest .\nA : and moreover it it has and everything , so that we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .\nB : so we give that six , .\nD : it does have .\nC : voice control have seven .\nB : hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ?\nB : that's just , .\nC : that's the second one .\nC : so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .\nA : so it has voice control .\nB : yes , so that's seven then .\nA : anyway it ha , it's the most sophisticated remote that ever seen .\nC : but in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .\nD : we have we have the sample speaker as , which is , it's new .\nB : but you don't they're never been used they've never been using remote remote control before don't think .\nC : all of the components have been used in other things before .\nD : but at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .\nA : but they've been brought together in remote .\nC : but do , .\nC : what do you reckon , five , six ?\nB : what do you all think ?\nD : how how far can you go with remote control , really ?\nB : that's it , , but everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ?\nD : it still has to do what what it has to do .\nB : so , don't think many peop that's it , they can take it with them .\nC : put fashion in electronics .\nD : isn't it fashionable ?\nA : the carrot banana remote .\nD : it's the maximum fashion .\nB : so , we give it seven , and we write there we go .\nD : fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .\nD : so we've done very , but what's the assessment ?\nB : so , we need the average here , so we got seven so we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen .\nD : the average is about six and something .\nD : little bit over six .\nA : there are how many sixes ?\nD : no , , little bit under six .\nA : one , two , three .\nA : and one five .\nD : three sixes , , .\nC : fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .\nA : twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six .\nA : forty six and five , fifty one .\nC : six point point about six point five .\nA : fifty one divided by it'll have to for bit .\nD : six point something , .\nB : two three four seven eight .\nD : six point five , .\nB : that's pretty good , .\nC : now until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .\nC : that's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?\nB : no , that's it , .\nC : so , finance .\nC : and we'll see if we can unscrew this first .\nB : there we go .\nC : this is i'm just beautiful .\nB : there we go and there are the marks .\nC : computer no signal ?\nC : there we go .\nC : so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .\nC : and now we have to calculate the production costs .\nC : so i've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that .\nC : can you read that ?\nC : more or less .\nC : started filling it in , but these are provisional , so we have to go down .\nC : no hand dynamo , ?\nC : one simple battery .\nC : no kinetic energy , no solar .\nC : the chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .\nC : we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nC : single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .\nC : case material we said rubber .\nC : what special colour means .\nA : anything which is not more .\nD : something coloured , , probably .\nD : so this is probably special co no ?\nC : it could be rub rubber comes coloured , it's would it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .\nB : but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ?\nD : or if you want some pattern thing on it , , .\nC : let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy .\nB : you might end up having to take off the sample sensor .\nC : we we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?\nD : we have pushbuttons , scro we have scroll wheel as .\nC : for the muting .\nD : , we had , for muting , .\nA : no we we have .\nD : and we have l_c_ display and .\nC : and button supplements .\nD : but what do we ha we have l_c_ display , but but the wh but the spinning wheel .\nA : we don't have we're not using any of that .\nC : but the the spinning wheel's not there .\nC : have think it's integrated with the l_c_ display ?\nB : we've got more than one pushbutton though , haven't we ?\nB : 'cause then you have that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ?\nC : if that's one .\nB : not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .\nC : that seems unlikely .\nC : push what whether whether pushbutton means that count by button or do we don't think that makes sense .\nA : wh wh what is the limit ?\nB : twelve point five .\nD : we have to count all of them , or .\nA : don't , no .\nB : doesn't , but it and l_c_ display .\nA : no it says what what is the interface , if it is pushbutton then you got zero point five , it's scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and display , so that's that's the three interfaces that we have .\nC : so , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .\nA : wh wh what's our criteria ?\nB : this sample sensor .\nC : our budget's twelve point five .\nB : the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .\nC : so that has implications though for the .\nA : it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker .\nA : when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .\nC : for the locator .\nB : but that's bit of gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?\nA : and the locator also goes away .\nB : we can afford to get rid of it .\nD : but it was very no innovative innovativeness .\nB : so that means no locator , does it ?\nC : what else does it need ?\nD : the speaker the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .\nC : 'cause the sample speaker was , , more complicated then just beeping thing .\nD : this would be , there you record your samples your speech samples and , then then we would be in the budget .\nC : , so we .\nA : also in the case i'm not that you will evaluate this as curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably flat surface rubber .\nC : so we need one fifty off .\nA : so tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make selection in in the ?\nB : see , was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause but that's you would just have to to spin it down .\nC : take it down to just scroll wheel .\nC : we could do .\nA : if in the we can scroll , ?\nA : but how do we make selection if we cannot push the button .\nD : no no , you can push this one , but we don't have pushbutton we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .\nC : you can have to scroll it straight roll it straight down for for mute .\nB : so that's point three .\nA : no but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and we were referring to this as scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .\nD : but we can put an additional mute button on the top as .\nB : that wouldn't actually cost any more .\nB : that's the spin wheel though , isn't it ?\nB : didn't that come with the l_c_ .\nC : that's with the l_c_ we decided , 'cause it's not on our list .\nA : that comes with the ?\nA : so so the the this is .\nC : the scroll wheel is on the side .\nA : so we're adding costs for , this is good .\nB : so we're point three over .\nC : we're point three over at the moment .\nC : it's nothing , have .\nB : unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume .\nB : could still put them on the side .\nB : the scroll wheel's pretty , but .\nA : instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down .\nA : on the side .\nA : it sounds good actually , .\nC : rather than having three different things that people have to do .\nC : there we go .\nC : look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .\nB : could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ?\nC : or or that we have to have some special colour .\nC : so that's alright .\nC : we we'll leave it at that and then i'll take send it back to management and say we weren't quite about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , .\nA : we have , .\nC : so did we lose on our evaluation criteria , as result of doing that ?\nB : no , don't .\nA : not really , no .\nA : because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep display .\nA : we instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .\nB : we just got rid of gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is essentially the two buttons that was it's not difference don't think .\nA : but we lose the locator .\nC : we're gonna have beep .\nD : 're going to have beeping thing .\nA : so instead of speaker , .\nD : but , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .\nB : that's not very exciting colour .\nB : you should make it more vegetable-like .\nD : which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the but it can be yellow as .\nB : the the beeper thing .\nB : it , jen wants it to vibrate .\nD : it can come in the same colour as the the case .\nC : 'cause we we won't have run out of our pot of play-doh .\nB : your pen vibrates ?\nC : know , my pen vibrates .\nC : but only for very short time .\nC : so looks like we've designed banana .\nC : done , team .\nC : we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have little talk about the project itself and how it went , so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing product .\nA : it one thing that was lacking was that we did not the various things cost to begin with .\nD : as far as creativity is concerned , there was there was room for creativity .\nD : the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .\nA : we kap kept adding things randomly .\nA : so , had we known , that or not , .\nB : if we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .\nA : so all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .\nC : but in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to meeting , that that worked in terms of .\nB : 'cause the meetings were so regular , .\nB : it wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be to have vibrating remote control shaped like banana , and then , , come back three days later and jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like banana .\nD : the the means were very very good , the means we used .\nC : the whiteboard digital pens .\nD : and the pens .\nB : like the pens .\nC : we like the pens .\nB : that would just be so , to do all your notes and don't think you should say that was the recording .\nC : you could take it to lectures and just write down and have it printed out when you got back to the office .\nA : that's it's it's wonder what one of these costs .\nC : do you think they'd notice if one went ?\nB : cover up the microphone .\nB : alright , let's take it .\nC : but that worked having having whiteboard that we could draw on as as having the powerpoint , 'cause the find that the problem with powerpoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , .\nB : it is bit limiting , isn't it ?\nD : and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the .\nB : the thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so .\nC : that's alright , that always irritates me anyway , .\nB : not that you can do that on the board , either .\nB : we could make some little , , that was fairly tight anyway , especially with that last-minute alteration .\nD : but , but already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , .\nB : back it , this is just had to be changed .\nB : and , so .\nB : are we supposed to say things about jen now ?\nC : and presumably you don't you can say nasty things as .\nD : was was satisfied with with the leadership , .\nC : have no stake in it .\nB : you weren't like dictating leader , so that was always good .\nC : you have to say that , 'cause i'm taking the notes .\nC : i'll leave the room and you can have another go .\nB : know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it .\nC : better than that than the banana .\nD : and then the teamwork it worked quite quite nicely , .\nC : it worked quite .\nC : did anyone feel that they were getting covered up and not being able to say their bit ?\nD : to express them no .\nA : it was fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , .\nC : new ideas found .\nC : not quite what about .\nD : t's it's it's pretty new , pretty novel solution for for remote control really , all this flipping open thing and , neither neither do , but i've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .\nB : don't go shopping for remote controls that often , somebody's already though of it .\nB : i'll be looking out next time need to write an essay .\nB : that looks boring , i'll see if anyone's made remote control .\nD : we could have patent on this one .\nD : patent patent patent .\nB : we'd like to think the ideas were new , but we've got no way of finding out .\nC : or you can always go to google and type in banana remote control .\nB : that vibrates , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .\nC : nothing that you really want .\nC : so , costs are within budget , within budget , including little what have we got ?\nC : one euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .\nC : we've evaluated the project .\nC : you've got the scores .\nB : and it's fabulous .\nC : can you put that in the project documents file ?\nB : it's in the project documents .\nC : it's in there already .\nC : and the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with .\nC : were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?\nD : and my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\nD : otherwise it's it's all fine .\nB : , sometimes it's like little bit rushed .\nA : that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and .\nA : although we could have made the r_s better had we had five more minute .\nC : we're still within our time .\nB : we've got like five minutes left .\nC : we've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished .\nC : we're just too too efficient and you should never drag meeting on just because you have extra time .\nA : we certainly are , .\nC : so would say that's the end of that meeting .\nD : it was pleasure working with you .\nC : it was very productive day and no .\nB : we could draw animals on the board again .\nD : you can make some animals .\nB : don't like play-doh , no .\nD : you don't like anim it doesn't ?\nB : it's just minging .\nB : it smells so bad .\nD : smells very sweet .\nC : so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\nA : was there questionnaire already sent ?\nC : if it's already sent or not .\nB : no , it hasn't been .\nC : presumably have to don't see

?\nA : does anybody know ?\nA : so that's this , .\nB : are we free to take notes .\nA : just hang on second everybody .\nA : haven't actually looked at this yet .\nA : haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens .\nA : if you're all ready .\nA : so is the agenda ?\nA : opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing .\nA : project aim is new remote control .\nA : it's original , trendy and it's user-friendly .\nA : project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and meeting of details design , individual work and meeting .\nA : try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .\nA : miss industrial designer , would you like to go first ?\nB : so are we supposed to bring the little things for the .\nA : why don't you just , just clip on clip do you have belt ?\nA : or put in your pocket , .\nB : so my favourite animal , it's big , it's got memory .\nA : what's your favourite animal ?\nA : is it rude ?\nD : it's an elephant .\nA : that's very good elephant .\nC : the back end of an elephant .\nD : my gosh , i'm never gonna be able to draw that .\nA : and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your your favourite characteristics of that animal .\nB : supposed to have memory , we say an elephant never forgets .\nB : and dunno know why but looks like to me .\nA : wonderful , done .\nA : do you want to use the wipe the the wiper and wipe it off ?\nA : and mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ?\nD : have no idea what my favourite animal is .\nC : my favourite animal , let's see .\nC : dunno if any of you have seen napoleon dynamite before .\nC : it's liger , combination of lion and tiger .\nC : have you not seen napoleon dynamite ?\nC : it's hilarious movie .\nC : you have to see it .\nC : and and it's best characteristic is it's the awesomest animal .\nC : but you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it .\nA : miss mar miss marketing ?\nD : not quite how this is gonna work .\nD : 'll try my best to draw .\nD : can draw the face ?\nA : you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks .\nA : that's very pr pretty cat .\nD : which also has what ?\nD : big fat body and big and long tail .\nA : do do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ?\nD : and usually cats are very friendly .\nD : and they're healing as .\nD : and they can feel when human's got problems so so , that's why like cats .\nA : so they're kinda spiritual .\nD : there we are , that's me .\nA : don't actually have favourite animal , but for the for for this meeting i'll draw little .\nA : honestly can't draw for toffee .\nB : that's not bad would say .\nA : no no that's exactly what it is .\nA : not very good one , , you got it's it's squirrel , and like them , because they're cute and stupid .\nC : that's pretty good .\nA : so , that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .\nA : let's move on to the next page .\nA : project finance , selling price twenty five euros , profit aim fifty million euros .\nD : market range internationally sold .\nA : production cost , it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make .\nA : experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what .\nA : next meeting starts in thirty minutes .\nA : at quarter to twelve .\nC : so before we close , we are expected the last slide wanted us to discuss longer what our what our ideas where .\nC : if you wanna go back to the last slide .\nC : we're before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for .\nA : so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like now are we or .\nA : this was just giving us instructions for the re to do next , but .\nC : this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into new one .\nA : who's got experiences with remote controls then ?\nC : we've all got .\nB : is this t_v_ one we are supposed to make ?\nD : it's t_v_ remote control .\nB : but how do we know how much , , how much do we have per how much ?\nD : new remote control for t_v_ .\nD : what would like ?\nA : what you want it big do you want it small .\nA : are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going that's that's big and video and ts hi-fi and .\nC : it seems like there's like there's tension between two ideas , , you want you want one remote that can work all all of the functions of t_v_ and if you have whatever associated with t_v_ the d_v_d_ player , like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with thousand buttons on it .\nA : you now that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .\nA : 'cause was thinking something that's got different like an display on it that's got different pages for different devices , but that would that would probably be quite expensive .\nC : it can't be more than twelve fifty per unit .\nA : per unit , .\nB : so do we have to be realistic within the budget or close pr how much it would cost .\nA : at the moment we could , wa we 'cause we this is what we what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not .\nD : couldn't we have like one that comes out ?\nA : so would be to have something that that controls lots of different things .\nD : like so you have one in like it doesn't have to be really thick .\nD : remote controls can be thin bits .\nD : and then you have one for your d_v_d_ and you slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out .\nD : and then it all comes compact into one .\nD : so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and into one .\nA : that's an idea .\nD : so you just flip them out .\nB : have one very complicated one on one side with all the d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ access and , and then on the other side one remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , .\nB : real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .\nA : one side for kids , one side for adults .\nC : i'm not if that's like i'm not if it's good idea to have two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .\nB : or grandma as , it's like what is the mute button .\nB : no , but you would slide it into someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but start breaking up .\nA : like it like flip telephone , something like that .\nD : that would be .\nD : was thinking that like flip .\nA : flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside .\nA : we've got five minutes left .\nA : 've got we've got few ideas there .\nC : we should by the end of this meeting we should have at least rough conception stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have .\nC : so we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're that we want are that it can control the t_v_ , but also devices connected to the to the t_v_ , , be able to operate d_v_d_ players , things like that .\nA : have got we should also have back-up plan of 'cause think that it might be expensive to make something that we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything .\nA : we should have back-up plan of just really good television remote control , that just that is just for t_v_ , but it's just really good , one .\nA : what do you reckon ?\nA : see 'cause , i'm just thinking bearing in mind we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make .\nC : that's true , we should just concentrate on having good t_v_ remote , and have it be have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , simple to use , and looks decent and sorta find niche for our remote , like market it to certain people , certain certain demographic , no you're .\nA : we'll be able to come up with ideas and lot quicker .\nA : may , even or even so something that's for disabled people or so people that don't see very or big buttons for touchy buttons for .\nD : but what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ?\nD : if it's if it's just like .\nA : or just one that looks really fucking .\nB : could be really light or , , something special .\nC : rathe rather than focus on .\nA : otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that we sh we should .\nB : 'cause at the end of the day if it says just t_v_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the .\nA : everyone we're sounds like we're all bit gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but , that's .\nC : remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside .\nA : i'd like one that makes tea as , but that's not gonna happen .\nD : flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and , the telephone's the television switched on .\nD : so something that like does have lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press button or record button .\nA : like lock like lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , .\nD : but make it like really snazzy and people will want it .\nD : so make it .\nA : it's gotta be sellable .\nC : that's true what you were saying , it doesn't have to have flip function , it can just have lock function , so that it's not not usable when you don't want it to be usable .\nD : and even for kids as .\nD : it's it's safer for them , .\nD : like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto .\nA : no porn channel for children .\nA : alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got let's move on .\nC : that's good good for now .\nA : let's close that .\nA : next meeting , .\nD : what does i_d_v_i_d_n_m_e_ stand for ?\nA : industrial designer which is .\nD : these are requirement specification .\nD : and i'm marketing .\nA : there you go .\nA : so user interface designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need .\nA : industrial designer , you are the one , , you're gonna be working out box it goes in , so , whether it's what goes into the box , somehow .\nB : har how it works an bu do you think our two overlap , because .\nA : and in marketing user requirements specifications .\nD : these are requirement specification .\nD : so what the user requires in remote .\nA : what , , .\nC : it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .\nD : that's what it says .\nA : you two you two are gonna be just , , you just double up , , you working together .\nA : you're the one that's gotta go and find out do do the research , see what people want in remote , what buttons are used more often , and like that .\nA : we've been warned to finish the meeting now .\nA : everyone , done .\nC : alright , see you in thirty minutes .\nD : so , do we take these off ?"], ["<t> The project

all were .\nC : have one too , .\nC : whoops forgot to put the thing on .\nA : wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again .\nA : just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll .\nC : that's good idea .\nA : so , and gabriel .\nB : i'm catherine with c_ .\nB : c_a_t_h_ e_r_ i_n_e_ .\nA : e_l_ is it ?\nA : and you're r_e_i_s_s_ .\nA : 's just bit nicer calling people by their names .\nA : , welcome to meeting .\nA : this is gonna go lot better than the last meeting , , 'cause i'm supposed to be doing now .\nA : am your project manager , and , , i'm just here to liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and i'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and .\nA : this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is i'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , , filling out silly questionnaires and things .\nA : but hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive .\nA : so we're gonna each of you gonna give us litt little presentation .\nA : then we're gonna work , , from each of your presentations .\nA : we'll we'll talk about what we actually need as final coming together of it all .\nA : and then we'll , , we'll conclude anything else comes up at the end of it .\nB : how long is the meeting ?\nA : this meeting it's not very long .\nA : it's probably down to about thirty five minutes now .\nA : so want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .\nA : if you haven't done powerpoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium .\nA : if you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can however you want to do your little presentation , , you can .\nA : don't feel pressurised into using this thing .\nA : you over there ?\nA : reissa , are you are you joining in with this meeting here or are or are or are you are you just are you just doing some internet shopping there ?\nC : think she's finishing up her presentation .\nD : i'm finishing off my presentation .\nA : alright , let's have , we all know that it's it's remote control that we're gonna be dealing with .\nA : the first thing we should look at is probably the what it is that it is actually supposed to be .\nA : so that's gonna be you catherine , if we wanna hear from you first .\nB : just connecting this .\nB : are we getting really ?\nA : you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go .\nB : so i've got very quick .\nB : so the working design , i've got very quick presentation on this , so i've no , you can't see thing .\nB : i'm gonna draw it on the board then .\nB : it's in blue , and couldn't change it .\nB : we it's fine on my screen , but never mind .\nB : so the idea is that we've got the energy source , which in our case will pr , , never mind .\nB : so two batteries , what they're called six , like that .\nB : and then then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal , which could be an infra-red signal , which will be sent by an electronic chip .\nB : and the chip will be controlled by the user interface .\nB : so we'll hear about that later from gabriel .\nB : and the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .\nB : and that's it really for the working design .\nB : the presentation wasn't very clear but really ?\nA : prefer the pe prefer the human touch personally .\nB : should erase this or .\nA : do you wanna just give us moment , wanna copy this down .\nA : if you have got any questions for catherine on any of this ?\nD : is battery like the only way of no , no no like no 'cause like cha 'cause always changing batteries can get like annoying .\nB : it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , in indoors .\nC : alternate energy source , like win wind power or bicycle power .\nA : you blow on it and , it's worked for the last fifty years .\nD : the battery's down and , , solar charged ?\nB : swi changing your batteries once every six months is not really pain , but .\nC : one question have , and how much control we have over this is , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the t_v_ , and still have it be operational ?\nC : we want one with strong signal stream .\nA : how far away is your television ?\nA : it's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got t_v_ the size of football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , does it ?\nB : the thing is you you don't , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it .\nA : doesn't have to go through wall , because you're not gonna be looking through wall .\nD : but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nB : didn't think about that but why not ?\nD : how about bluetooth ?\nD : instead of using infra-red , use bluetooth .\nD : isn't that better signal ?\nB : think that it's it's gonna cost more and i'm i'm not it's you're gonna use it .\nA : it sounds like you you don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nA : we don't need it .\nB : it's fancy idea it's quite , but then don't , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , you are gonna but , we can we can keep the idea if you we can see at later stage , , don't do you need the border ?\nA : we're we're desi we're designing and marketing television remote control unit .\nA : we're not designing something that you can plug in headset to and and connect to your laptop computer and .\nD : 's just an idea .\nA : done , catherine .\nA : gab gabriel let's let's hear from you on on on such things .\nC : i'm just gonna use the powerpoint .\nC : so , while this is warming up , there it is .\nC : so i'm doing the user interface design .\nC : and , as far as methods , was was looking looking at looking at already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there .\nC : thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , what we what we can perfect little bit as far as design .\nC : we don't want to do something that's too radical of change , , people want remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities and and does the basics , but so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want .\nC : so things that seem like absolute must-haves would be volume control , so up-down keys for that , channel keys up-down , but then also numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and mute button .\nC : one thing that didn't include here , that forgot that we talked about last time , was doing some lock function .\nC : don't , that's one possibility .\nC : and so in the research that was doing there's two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which if access the web page from here , but show you .\nC : so this is engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , freeze frame .\nC : and this is user centred one .\nC : it's it's easier to just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nC : and judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting gathered that that's what we were going after , or the direction we were going in at least .\nC : so , the engineering centred ones provide lot of functionality , but it can be little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use .\nC : and this overlaps with what the marketing person , reissa , because we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nC : so , , that's me .\nA : now that's have question for you .\nA : this research that you've been doing looki looking at other , , existing units .\nA : have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or .\nC : no that that that seemed like novel idea as as far as know .\nC : another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nC : that was the inspiration for it .\nC : i've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business .\nC : i've , haven't i've never seen locking functionality .\nC : what do you have yea or nay on that feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nA : would say it's if it's simple to do , which it probably should be , even if it's physical , , like physical switch or physical cover for the remote , even something like that , then yes , it's like , , like you said earlier on ab ab ab flip thing , something like that , but being physical .\nA : i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred , something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit .\nA : it's gotta look like it's in the and .\nA : the the company it's it's , from what see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them .\nC : and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nA : we put the fashion in electronics .\nC : we have to carry that mental .\nA : there you go .\nA : so it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and something fashionable .\nA : if if remote control , if telephones can be fashionable , then remote control units can be .\nC : these , , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what didn't mention yet really is is the like the ergonomic design .\nA : because we need .\nC : we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , .\nC : everything is going ergonomic , , there's mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches in the market , .\nA : done , gabriel .\nD : where does it go into ?\nA : let's plug you in , baby .\nD : the blue thing .\nC : , this is getting all .\nC : then you just have to do function eight and it should come up .\nA : it it just takes wee while .\nC : it just takes second .\nD : for our marketing report we observed remote control users in usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants questionnaires to fill out .\nD : total number of people tested were hundred just so , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings .\nD : so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly .\nD : so they don't like the look of the remote control .\nD : eighty eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really and fancy .\nD : so we all agree with that .\nD : current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user .\nD : so , they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave .\nD : per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\nA : 'cause we've only got five channels .\nD : that's another thing .\nD : seventy five per cent of users say they zap .\nD : not quite what they mean , zap , goes like .\nA : that's flicking quickly between channels .\nC : you wanna navigate the channels quickly .\nD : takes too much time to learn how to use new remote .\nD : especially for the older generation .\nD : know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use .\nD : anyway and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nD : so tracking devices is good idea .\nA : you are child of technology , aren't you ?\nD : so was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people .\nD : has to look really , flashy groovy for people to buy it .\nD : and it's easy to find , so whether and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in voice activating .\nD : so voice activation .\nD : so and this was what we came up with .\nD : then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , , age groups .\nD : so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nA : so there you go , .\nD : so the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want voice activated one .\nD : and neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want voice act speech recognition in remote .\nA : but do the younger generation have the money ?\nC : no would would say the older the older people , .\nA : they they don't .\nA : it's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and people people from the age of thirty there's big drop off there .\nD : the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so so they don't these are growing up .\nA : for people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , , they want it .\nA : but no they're not most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nC : that would be my as .\nA : and tha and that's that's quite minority there , so , it's not even like fifty fifty that's thirty five per cent .\nC : what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?\nC : if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nD : voice activation might not be the best .\nA : would say scra i'd say scrap that straight off .\nD : also with with buttons , thing called r_s_i_ , so wrist sense ?\nC : repetitive strain rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing .\nD : repetitive strains injury , so they don't people who watch t_v_ too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nB : they shouldn't watch so much t_v_ then .\nA : so so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have look into then when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have look if there's any any medical background we can find out about this .\nD : not so hard .\nB : it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching .\nA : let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nC : we should probably consult with our legal department .\nA : they're having lunch break at the moment , but .\nA : i'll see if get see if get hold of them for the next meeting .\nC : we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\nD : the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something .\nD : so that is me .\nA : that's , very much for that , reissa .\nA : so we've we've decide we've we've decided that it's gonna be , , we're going for basic television remote .\nA : it's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look .\nA : it's gotta be cheap .\nA : now going back to the industrial design of it , , we were looking at whether to use infra-red or bluetooth .\nA : we should just go with the simplest option on everything , and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries .\nA : mean we we can look into using the , , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries .\nA : but in there's no don't think there's any point in making remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , , we won't have televisions in ten years' time .\nA : so we're all pretty sussed on that .\nA : anyone have any questions ?\nA : everybody happy in their work ?\nC : it seems like we're all on the on the same page .\nA : now this is good , we've got good structure going on .\nA : we all know where we're going to .\nA : have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ?\nC : it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager .\nC : sell trying to sell your things .\nA : do have you found out if we can if we can e-mail to each other ?\nA : do all you all know my e-mail address ?\nD : he's participant one , aren't you ?\nB : in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , .\nC : it's just participant one .\nB : so project manager , it's participant one at a_m_i_ .\nA : can you all e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?\nC : t's just it's just it's just par participant one , participant two .\nB : you have them you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail .\nA : send me , , .\nB : you want to have friends , don't you ?\nC : so are we headed towards like big yellow and black remote as far as that's our next meeting that we discuss that .\nA : is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ?\nA : thought it was blue writing on yellow background , but might be just going bit .\nC : it's like white on white and blue on black background with white with yellow borders .\nC : that's like getting ahead of ourselves .\nA : you can come up with few with couple of different ideas ?\nB : it wouldn't be you could it could come but it could come in different colours and have the r_r_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the r_r_ logo or colours and if .\nD : can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of certain ?\nA : see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image .\nA : it's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's real reaction product .\nD : but if it's r_r_ , it would be real reaction , like if it had symbol on it .\nA : there's loads of companies that called r_r_ .\nA : this is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type .\nC : and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , , we are beholden to them .\nD : so we have to have it one colour .\nC : not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .\nA : but we have to incorporate it .\nA : not necessarily even if it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to sony product or , , panasonic product .\nA : it's got to so , so you can have look at our our other products and see if they all follow similar vein , perhaps .\nA : this is all your department .\nA : and , we stop for lunch now .\nC : pretty soon , that's now .\nD : are we are we finished ahead of schedule ?\nA : we might possibly have done .\nC : alright , see you all soon .\nA : if we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch .\nA : there you go .\nA : have to there's few little bits and pieces have to write down , but take your headsets off , kick back , smoke if you got ."],

i've always wanted one of these , really have .\nD : where do you buy from ?\nA : back again for another wonderful meeting .\nA : is everyone ready ?\nA : we we can hold on for minute .\nA : figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in .\nC : that's the spam that everybody likes to receive .\nA : are you ready ?\nA : , , take it that you are all ready now .\nA : alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting .\nA : which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .\nA : what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today .\nA : we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .\nC : do you have any preference of order ?\nA : i'd like to hear i'd like to hear who's who's on the from from catherine actually first .\nA : want what i'd like to hear about is if we've finally decided on what energy we're gonna be using and it's just that , let's let's hear from you first .\nC : she is still finishing her .\nB : no no no no , it's fine i'm just preparing .\nB : where is that thing ?\nC : it's is it like crank thing .\nB : would that work ?\nA : get yourself in position .\nB : so that's me again .\nB : so for the energy sources we can have basic battery , hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that which wouldn't be wouldn't be , .\nA : don't think any of us remember the fifties .\nB : it wouldn't be very fancy .\nB : you can have kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days .\nB : so if you have just bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work .\nB : or you can use solar cells , but i'm not about that indoors , really , but .\nC : there's sometimes combinations , , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .\nA : do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from light bulb ?\nA : does anybody know ?\nC : it has to be on the on the solar energy , but .\nB : think the the what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .\nB : and if we want something fancier , the kinetic provision of energy could be , but if it's worth the cost .\nB : so we've got to discuss that .\nB : for the case of the remotes itself , they can be general case , which is just flat one .\nB : you can have curved one or double curved one , if what , so , more ergonomic , that suits the palm of your hand , that thing .\nA : what's double curved one ?\nB : so then the case material itself , so it can be either plastic or latex , rubber , wood , or titanium .\nB : and for each of them you have cases where titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing double curved case , we can't choose titanium .\nB : and if we are choosing solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account .\nB : but if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything .\nB : and we discussed earlier on the problem thing , so we could .\nA : so that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , .\nC : let's have squeezable remote .\nB : and also it doesn't break as easily , so rubber would be .\nA : when t_v_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you .\nA : like that idea .\nD : rubber's but after my after my fashion thing , you'll realise that rubber is more people .\nA : rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ?\nA : you think you can market that ?\nA : we like rubber , .\nB : and then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or scroll-wheels , like you have on mouse , or you could have , which gives you display .\nB : scroll buttons , as .\nB : so if you use rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons .\nB : so if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case .\nB : and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .\nB : so it's constraint .\nA : we're gonna go with we've decided that it's gonna be rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel ?\nB : but is it double curved one or not ?\nB : if it's not double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons .\nB : if that makes sense .\nC : if it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double isn't rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ?\nC : mean so what's the difference between normal rubber case and rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?\nB : no , but na le you see , you've got , , the energy that's one thing , then you have the case is , whether it's flat or curved .\nA : rubble double double .\nA : i'll have big mac , .\nB : and that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material .\nB : so if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved .\nB : and i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go why , but we need to go for rubber push-buttons .\nB : so , either we just need to decide on the on the case .\nA : let's have rubber push buttons , .\nC : go rubber the whole way .\nB : let's go crazy .\nB : and then , do have last slide ?\nB : yes , do .\nB : so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons .\nB : and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest .\nB : if we get scroll-wheel , that's higher price range .\nB : if we get an advanced chip which is used for the , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .\nA : chip on print .\nA : what i'm not understanding here is , , advanced chip on print , which presume is like one p_c_b_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the infra-red sender ?\nA : what what alternatives do we have to that ?\nA : what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?\nB : if if it's not chip on print then , , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red .\nB : it's less expensive technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too .\nA : so it sounds so , why would we not go for that ?\nA : if it's something that's inside the the unit .\nB : fo it doesn't , , , .\nA : it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .\nA : we wanna go for an all so long as it works , .\nB : so let's not go for the , .\nA : so let's not let's not bother with the chip on print .\nB : so it's either the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .\nD : what about the just developed sample sensor ?\nA : what about what ?\nD : there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .\nB : t'd be it'd be , but they are saying they've just developed it , i'm just guessing .\nA : what do we need speaker for in remote control unit ?\nB : but it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and .\nC : the the speech recognition option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us , 'cause the the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , , you can program sample wi that when you say something it will give response , and you program the response as .\nA : it's not something that we wanna go into with this product .\nC : just clips of tha that you record yourself .\nC : so you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello rick , or whatever .\nC : but , , it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t_v_ on like , turn the t_v_ on , and turns comes on , but it's not that .\nC : it just gives you it just gives you verbal response .\nD : it just gives an answer .\nC : so , , , like what's the point of saying , hello remote , , hello , how how are you ?\nD : then then it was when they said when they said , voice recognition , they meant like , channel five , and it will change .\nB : just if you are really lonely , .\nC : if you're really lonely , it is it's no , tha that that that would be more promising .\nB : and then it switches on .\nD : like you talk to it .\nD : can have channel five ?\nC : it it's just remote that talks to you .\nD : then forget about it .\nC : to certain cues .\nB : so i'll go back , , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose .\nB : so for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the cheaper option .\nC : i'm fine with the basic battery .\nA : it's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work .\nB : are you happy with that ?\nB : so we'll go for the battery .\nB : then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?\nA : we were go we were going with the late with the the r_s_i_ rubber , weren't we ?\nC : so we want it rub rubber double curved .\nA : the the the double whopper , .\nD : so it will look like something like this .\nB : so then if we use double curved case , then we have to choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ?\nA : but we're going for the simple buttons .\nC : so rubber rubber keys , .\nA : and it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as 'cause we were saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that the the people have the people were getting the complaining about r_s_i_ , and this is anti-r_s_i_ .\nA : so that's another marketing point that we can use .\nD : the rubber push-buttons .\nD : don't you have to move your .\nA : but anything is gonna have buttons .\nA : even if it's jog wheel , it's still repetitive .\nB : they would give an option of flat buttons or that they don't .\nA : you you see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing button or pressing flat bit of screen .\nA : it's the it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement .\nA : it's not actually what you are doing .\nA : but the fact that this this rubber is actually used in these anti-r_s_i_ ps specific .\nD : the rubber's good .\nC : we're giving them way to burn off steam , , .\nD : so they can sit there and go like .\nC : not that watching t_v_ should be that stressful .\nA : and , , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children .\nC : t_v_ can be stressful , , if you're watching sports .\nB : alright , that's me done .\nA : let's let's let's hear from you about the it's the interface .\nC : some of what have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about .\nC : so i'm continuing with the user interface topic .\nC : and so consulted with our manufacturing division .\nC : it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them .\nC : also took reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration , 'cause that's that's crucial as far as what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out .\nC : and so the manufacturing division sent some some samples of of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , like the coffee machine .\nC : so already mentioned the speech recognition interface .\nC : we we vetoed that idea .\nC : it's it's pointless .\nC : it's just sample sensor sample output .\nC : it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t_v_ .\nC : so , they they also give the they they suggested the idea of using spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p_ three player like ipod .\nC : so we've already addressed that and that would actually be worse like r_s_i_ you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing .\nD : that does get annoying .\nC : the other suggestion , and have feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested , , going little bit into niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours , the keys might be , funny or or , or something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only few buttons .\nC : but we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done .\nC : so , the key layout and design are really crucial .\nC : you don't want you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use lot without always pressing the wrong one .\nC : and didn't mention that we need power button in our last give you an example here of , good layout and bad layout from our manufacturing department .\nC : so this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have v_ on both of them , so it's confusing for the user .\nC : this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose .\nA : do we have an example of good one ?\nC : and for kids .\nC : and so , , my personal preferences of we've all talked about and seemed to be on the same page .\nC : so was against the speech recognition st going towards anything in in niche sense .\nC : it should be more general .\nC : didn't didn't think the spinning-wheel or the l_c_ display were were crucial for us .\nC : and , , that's it for me .\nA : let's so what are our definite decisions on this then as team ?\nA : the the the the interface type we're going for just the simple simple straight set of buttons .\nC : so we're we're not gonna have any display .\nC : so , , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons .\nC : we shall have limited number of buttons , ideally , power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and numerical keypad .\nC : and some it will either have lock button like we mentioned or or cover like that .\nC : it's to the point where we need to decide about that .\nA : and we're not .\nC : now that we've decided on our it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too gaudy , but , would say mayb couple of colours like like black with with yellow and somewhere , like the r_r_ can be yellow , like that .\nA : are we gonna hav hav an are we have we decided on whether we're gonna supplement it with anything , , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go we're .\nA : don't have any other questions on this .\nA : let's move over to , .\nC : the fact also that we are having rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .\nC : 'cause so if we wanna have lock of some sort it would have to be button .\nC : but that should be , speak with the button department , but that it should be easy to have button that just prevents prevents the other the other buttons from operating .\nA : the button that just does that , .\nC : so that should be simple .\nD : i'm just letting what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year .\nD : so yes , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed .\nD : the most important aspect is look and feel .\nD : so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have .\nD : so it has to be .\nA : why should people buy this when they're already got remote that came with the t_v_ ?\nD : second , it should be technologically innovative innovative .\nD : so technologically it should be like work , , .\nA : what's that mean ?\nD : it should work .\nC : should be it should be cutting edge in some sense , have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .\nD : should that's new .\nA : now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the that works already , that's cheap .\nC : actually , , these first two points we've already gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy it's different , but wouldn't say like rubber remote is fancy .\nC : if that's what people want then we we're going in the wrong direction .\nC : and it's it's not technologically innovative either .\nD : so , no loose that's why was thinking , bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up bluetooth , and it's like bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , , 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .\nA : we could , they do .\nD : they do , but it's like it's not , but it looks good .\nA : one hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , i'm not gonna buy that , 'cause if it works or not .\nD : if it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration .\nA : , what do you two think about this ?\nC : so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics ?\nD : but like you could always insert , .\nA : what don't understand what , and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television .\nC : that's what it allows you to do , ?\nD : but , , people like , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .\nA : it would that would mean you'd need television that has bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ?\nB : bluetooth would , , enable you , , to connect you if you get call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs , you would get on your television you're being called by this person now .\nA : that would mean we'd have to make television as .\nB : things like that .\nA : no , that would be your telephone in with your television .\nC : the that wouldn't be the remote so much , .\nB : no no , but if you get bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to with the television , .\nA : and nah , the televi the television would have to be bluetooth compatible , .\nB : was just trying to find an advantage .\nB : wha what what advantage would you get for the the kinetic mo provision of energy then .\nD : it doesn't like it doesn't have to be , , bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , , is new .\nA : an and there is no there is no such thing .\nD : whether it's battery it could be something really really minor , , like but we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it .\nD : if we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and just go creative .\nB : it's been done for watches , but haven't seen that for remotes , yet .\nA : this that's that's very good .\nD : and then you can market it .\nD : never have to change battery again .\nB : change the batteries ever again .\nA : and and this is all tying in very nicely .\nA : the fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about .\nA : we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .\nB : , and in little characters you say , , but not too much .\nC : yes , so can , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator .\nA : but , by the squeezing it the , that's idea .\nD : third most important aspect is it's easy to use .\nD : and we've all worked that out .\nC : we're all about that .\nD : in the fashion , how it's supposed to look .\nD : next year's fashion very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .\nD : so next year people will be buying , found this really funny , , strawberry shaped chairs , and things .\nC : so we could have keys that are like like broccoli key and and an avocado key on them .\nA : wanna watch the pineapple channel .\nD : and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , would say is , so we're in .\nA : spongy , that's where .\nA : we're we're ahead of the game there .\nC : that's for us .\nD : and so personal what was just saying like move away from the current remote controls like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , .\nD : had to say so we're moving in the direction like .\nA : alright , , no , this this is good , so through all that we've we go we're , we're gonna go go back to going with the kinetic thing , that's , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-r_s_i_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and i'm not about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .\nC : how we incorporate we don't have to follow every trend , .\nD : make it like fruity colours .\nC : the power button could be like big apple .\nB : but apple would sue you for that .\nA : this is true .\nC : they don they don't own all images of apples .\nB : sued the beatles so .\nC : we'll make it pomegranate , big pomegranate .\nA : , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally on is its image .\nA : like , , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick thing ?\nD : if it's rubber it needs to be different .\nA : you said earlier on it should be funky .\nD : it's it should be , what do you associate with rubber ?\nD : like really different colours .\nA : keep it clean , keep it clean .\nD : sor , used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ?\nD : like i'm just thinking bright colours .\nD : bright natural colours , nothing too bright , but too not .\nA : bright , but not too bright .\nD : like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink .\nD : wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like .\nA : like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the and the the channel buttons should be one colour and like that , do you mean ?\nD : and on the back of it have the logo .\nC : the one thing i'm wondering about , hope that we're not going like too much down gimmicky road of of having if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then big spongy pink tomato remote .\nA : tha , we that's we we .\nA : this is the remote control tomato .\nC : what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ?\nD : can say in this country , you'll get , , lots of people wanting something really funky and .\nD : like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , mummy wanna buy that one .\nD : and parents will see the will see the pro as , because it's like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around .\nD : especially with younger kids , they can pick it up and and .\nD : the only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but .\nA : it's it's gotta be chew proof .\nD : so so it's rea it's quite it's quite like user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , .\nB : i'm gonna write that down .\nD : especially younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something .\nA : so , what are you saying , we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the .\nD : so like you walk in , you're like , like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , what colour would you like ?\nD : and then they go like , choose the colour .\nD : so it puts , , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing .\nD : so they also get to pick .\nD : personally like walking into shop and choosing colour .\nC : that that seems to work with for products like ipod , where , , you have variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , , just just by the fact of choosing .\nD : you've got the evaluation .\nB : although i'd be curious to see how many , there are some colours that wouldn would never choose , and would be curious how many people choose that colour .\nA : that's that can be down to bit of market researching , if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular .\nB : and produce less of the silly colours , .\nA : we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then is from you catherine wi your you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .\nA : gabriel , you're gonna be working on , come up with the the user interface design .\nA : then , you two are gonna be working together on this .\nA : you won't be going off to your separate offices .\nA : and you are gonna get chance to play with some clay .\nA : , it's gonna , come up ki , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some some physical ideas .\nA : 'cause at the moment , , it's it's hard .\nA : we were kinda going , , it's gotta feel , it's gotta look and that it's now we can actually start , , some physical something or other .\nC : that sounds good .\nA : and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .\nA : and will be talking to the bosses , , and fielding off some more spam and that's it really .\nA : keeping things , , ho hopefully keeping things together .\nA : that's this is this is good .\nA : so we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on .\nA : we definitely know how it's powered , we definitely know that it's gonna be simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down .\nA : it's this rubber casing that we can sell as fun and funky .\nA : of any other remote controls that are made out of this .\nA : people , , people are saying , , standard gives you repetitive strain injury , this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , it's supposed to fix it rather than it .\nA : we're gonna we we're gonna as extra something on it , what what extra things are there extra things this product have ?\nA : we'll look into this lock key facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible , , but something to look into .\nA : that's done everybody .\nA : anyone have any any questions , everyone they're doing ?\nA : 'cause if you don't , you'll i'm you'll soon get an e-mail about it .\nC : we all we need to do now .\nD : this gives you all the details ?\nA : it's we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish .\nA : but got note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire .\nC : i'll stay in here .\nC : does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that so we're buying fut , we're getting futures in the company .\nA : it's , , , it's gonna be par part more of profit sharing on the product .\nA : that's that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment .\nC : so we really have incentive to make this remote work .\nC : i'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing .\nA : want share in the space rocket .\nA : did you see that this that this company we've made spaceship .\nC : this company has its its fingers in lot of different pots .\nC : we're definitely not in the money making department .\nC : did notice looking at , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the r_r_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable .\nC : if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious .\nC : is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it it's just sil silver and black .\nA : and the spaceship doesn't have the have massive and down the side of it but still want one .\nA : i've just had sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting .\nC : , that's us .\nA : it's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet .\nA : so you should go back to your own offices .\nB : are we taking these off ?"], ["<t> The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the

 <t> *NA* </t>  <t> *NA*. </t>  <t> The need for separate right-handed and left-handed remotes. </t> ", "B : used to eat it .\nC : i've , i've definitely eaten it before .\nC : didn't know was edible .\nD : but , it's it's made edible 'cause , .\nA : it's it's chew proof .\nD : it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies .\nC : actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough .\nD : it is , .\nA : everybody everybody ready ?\nA : let's have your let's get have the presentation ?\nC : we've got some .\nB : we've got prototype .\nC : it's pretty exciting .\nC : so , everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , , double curved , but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market .\nC : so if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what thing we have going here .\nC : so , , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , , the thumb button is the power button .\nC : your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down .\nD : what's the big blue thing ?\nC : that's the lock button , has l_ l_ on it and then the m_ is mute button .\nC : and then it also has digit for muting the and then then you can also there's numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want .\nC : so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we t's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .\nA : that certainly does .\nC : so all the , the important keys are at your at at convenient place for you to to access them .\nC : so you don't you .\nB : which is ant anti-r_s_i_ .\nC : it should be .\nC : and it's also conformable to the size of your hand .\nC : if that's too big , it's rubber remote , so you can , change that .\nD : it's so cute .\nC : so does that what mesh with what you were hoping and for and expecting or does it , that's good thinking , .\nA : have one thing about it , but it's small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make right-handed one and left-handed one .\nA : but , that's don't see why that's not possible .\nC : if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed remotes .\nA : they make left-handed scissors , .\nD : but then but then you can learn to use your like was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?\nC : didn't didn't think about that , but i'd , .\nB : know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .\nD : i'm they'll be able to it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , , extraordinary .\nD : everybody can press button with their left and hand so , it's not .\nB : imagine are you handed ?\nB : imagine you're doing it with your left hand , don't t's too but we can have both .\nD : have them in stock .\nD : make more appealing as .\nA : but other than that , and that's , , that's just something , it's , , idea .\nC : do you says r_r_ ?\nA : it's , , if the r_r_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , i'd say that could be quite fashionable .\nC : fashion to electronics .\nC : and it's got the the black and yellow and blue .\nC : plus red , which is fruit and vegetable .\nB : there you go .\nC : so that's that's our end of things wha that's .\nA : very good , .\nA : it's come up with what we've , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , all seems to be there .\nD : and all the playing around is , i'm just do you wanna plug in ?\nA : before we move on need that cable .\nA : one thing do need to do we need to look at , is the costs .\nC : the costs , was that what you said ?\nB : play-doh is very cheap .\nD : play-doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , , it's gone .\nC : but it's edible .\nD : they'll buy more of them if you eat them , .\nC : that was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof .\nA : now we'll do this could do , do this on my own or could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power .\nA : and the electronics , we decided on it being just simple , the easiest thing that's inside it .\nA : so the case , we've gone for the double curved .\nA : and it's made out of rubber .\nA : the interface is push-buttons .\nA : and button supplements they're in diff special colours , aren't they ?\nA : so special colours .\nD : it's better for and special material .\nA : special form , , they're special form there in shapes and .\nC : , these these ones on the side are curved , so the buttons are rubber .\nA : are they made out of any special material ?\nA : no they're not .\nA : they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple .\nD : they're rubber , aren't they ?\nA : so let's see if that comes within budget .\nA : and it does .\nA : that is gonna cost .\nD : we're under budget .\nA : that's gonna cost ten ten euro seventy cents unit to make .\nA : and our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty .\nA : so , this is all very very good .\nC : and we're actua actually making better profit than we expected .\nA : the bosses will be very pleased .\nA : let's just save this so e-mail it to you .\nA : save it in save it in the my documents .\nD : it's already saved , .\nA : so , that's done with this with this doodah , so you're .\nA : gonna do what you were gonna do , your evaluation .\nD : this is where we all get to get to write on the , , on the board .\nA : love the smell of that play-doh .\nC : have some have some .\nD : so , evaluation .\nD : we're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria .\nD : i've got the criterias .\nD : and we have to do it on scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria .\nD : and the criterias are , and i'll draw this up on the board so we have box .\nD : and this is false , this is just like to keep you informed .\nD : so seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle .\nD : so the first criteria .\nD : do you all get what we're doing ?\nD : first criteria , look and feel .\nD : so the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ?\nD : as it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ?\nD : so what mark should we give for that ?\nA : would give it seven .\nD : as in it's not .\nD : so i'll just write criteria criteria one we get one .\nD : second criteria , new technology .\nD : have we implemented new technology ?\nD : as in the new high-tech so it's .\nB : the kinetic thing , .\nC : that was our main technological innovation every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .\nD : so we'll give it .\nC : it's ergonomic , but that's not that's that's design that's des that's design thing , .\nA : but that's not technological thing , that's another thing , that's another marketing thing .\nA : so on the technical side of it it easy to use .\nD : i'd say it's about twoish ?\nC : it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , , , .\nD : so criteria three is is it easy to use ?\nD : it's one , .\nA : i'd say it's wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not .\nA : would give it would give it two , 'cause it it it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but .\nD : two , so it's but if we make right-handed and left-handed then ?\nC : if we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then would give it one , but otherwise otherwise two .\nA : give it give it two .\nD : criteria four is costs .\nA : it's come in under budget .\nA : so that's definite one .\nA : amount of buttons .\nD : like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like lot le like so it's one ?\nA : contains only the necessary buttons .\nD : r_s_i_ is it good against ?\nA : so it's anti-r_s_i_ .\nD : and criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ?\nD : is it easy to get lost ?\nA : don't t's gonna get lost easily .\nC : it is very bright , .\nD : but it is smallish .\nC : it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between couch cushion , .\nD : it would , could be , could get lost .\nC : you could lost .\nD : it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say , it's not one , definitely .\nA : it no , , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but .\nC : it's bigger than the average mobile , .\nC : but , , it can get lost .\nD : the mobiles get lost all the time .\nC : , two is fine .\nD : but then you ring and you find them .\nD : so , that's that .\nD : so that's the evaluation , so i'd say yay .\nA : alright it's all all systems go .\nD : it's like like number one .\nB : we've , we've done .\nD : number one product .\nD : all done , .\nA : we can't fail .\nD : we fitted all the criterias .\nD : so so that's that one .\nA : done , reissa .\nA : wanna put in as project manager the , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , , both individually and as team .\nA : you've everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , and then come together and worked in , , integrally , , at the times , psp , , especially you two .\nA : that's all , , gone very very and and and be , has been good communication going on .\nC : during our design there was some some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it and and just just we just had to we just had to squeeze our product little bit and now you have been team .\nA : did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash few balls about ?\nC : think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other r_r_ teams , .\nA : so , , and we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design .\nD : in four diff in in four meetings .\nD : funny , all designer meetings could be this quick .\nA : this isn't simulation , this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just , , they get .\nC : they're actually trying to find ideas for ideal remote .\nD : they're using our ideas .\nA : two years' time this will be on the market .\nA : ex exactly that product thum we'll go , , we designed that and no-one will believe us .\nA : but no , when this meeting's finished like officially , there we'll get questionnaire to fill in .\nC : so at this stage , , is this the last meeting of the project ?\nC : we don't have another one after it's gone gone to marke market ?\nA : or six , haven't got message .\nD : just start summarising now .\nD : you can reply to the same message .\nD : see summary , there .\nD : if you just reply to that one .\nC : so there's no way to like predict what our 'cause we had we originally had as far as our financial goals , we had specific number for profits that we wanted .\nC : it was fifty mil fifty million don't remember .\nD : was it was it fifty or five ?\nC : but there's not way to compute that , , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?\nA : it gets handed over to another department .\nD : depends how much we sell .\nA : what our what our project was was to come up with the product , .\nA : the for the and just is it it come can is it within budget .\nA : when it when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , , the the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the , the all the in the profit sharing , .\nC : but we have vested interest prof profit sharing .\nA : we've we've we've made we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do .\nD : we finished an hour earlier .\nA : it's new , it's it's something that that isn't out there already .\nC : actually and one advantage of of this is that after the , , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be remote , .\nC : we're not we're not , tying tying our cart to that one horse .\nA : this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's new and looks bit quirky for people who want that , it's that it's , hang on , wrote it down here somewhere no thi put it in one of my e-mails that sent off .\nA : that , , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new .\nC : it make watching t_v_ healthy .\nA : and if you're not having good time with the t_v_ , you can throw it about , .\nA : it's fine , it's kid proof .\nD : just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them .\nA : you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that .\nA : so all in all , we've done very .\nA : drinks are on the company .\nA : in the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to .\nB : glad to hear that .\nA : as far as as far as know .\nD : we haven't got the five minute left thing yet .\nA : anyone wanna play spy ?\nC : it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence .\nC : should we call the day then ?\nA : we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire .\nA : it's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before .\nA : but i'm not the authority to say that it is .\nA : how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ?\nA : the using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?\nD : being all wired up and vibrating pen and it's .\nC : your moment to shine .\nA : thi , i'd i'd , as we said earlier , i've not never seen that before .\nA : something that the whiteboard thingy , that's .\nA : but pen with camera on it , don't t's such new thing .\nA : it's or in such new idea .\nA : it would be different if it was hand writing recognition , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on computer screen as picture file rather than actual text .\nC : they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step .\nC : we should end this , since we're off off topic ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and introduced herself to the

team .\nA : i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting .\nA : my name is rose lindgren .\nA : i'll be the project manager .\nA : our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise .\nA : and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes .\nA : first of all our project aim .\nA : we are creating new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\nA : i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those .\nA : so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts .\nA : first the functional design which will be first we'll do individual work , come into meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and meeting .\nA : so that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and collaborating .\nA : we're gonna get to know each other little bit .\nA : so , what we're gonna do is start off with let's start off with amina .\nA : alima , , alima .\nA : we're gonna do little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you .\nA : introduce yourself , say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it .\nB : which one of these have to bring with me .\nB : so , i'm supposed to draw my favourite animal .\nB : have no drawing skills whatsoever .\nB : but let's see , introduce myself .\nB : my name is alima bucciantini .\nB : i'm from the state of maine in the us .\nB : i'm doing nationalism studies , blah , blah , blah , and have no artistic talents .\nA : how do you spell your name ?\nB : and i'm the industrial designer on this project .\nB : so let's see if get here .\nB : will draw little turtle for you all .\nB : not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that they're drawable .\nB : and you have the pretty little shell going on .\nB : some little eyes .\nB : there you go .\nA : so what are your favourite characteristics ?\nB : like the whole having shell thing .\nB : it's quite carry your home around where you go , quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , and they're easy to draw .\nA : shall we just go around the table ?\nC : my name is iain and i'm the user interface designer for the project .\nC : and i'll try and draw my favourite animal .\nC : i'll should leave that one on there shouldn't before callously rub it off .\nB : no , you can erase the turtle , it's alright .\nA : might be to have them all up there at same time .\nC : i'm not gonna draw it quite to scale .\nC : is that at least identifiable ?\nC : it's whale , yes .\nB : it's , cat .\nD : my , it's better than what i'm gonna be able to do .\nC : and , , the reason like whales is 'cause they're , first of all they're quite intelligent and also they're they're mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups .\nC : and find them interesting animals .\nD : take my contraptions with me .\nD : alright , i'm jessy .\nD : i'm from around d_c_ ish in the u_s_ .\nD : and we're gonna keep the deep sea theme going on , animal .\nD : don't really know how to draw this .\nD : just where can .\nD : if do the water , but how ?\nD : give an idea .\nD : have no idea how one would explain this .\nD : with some whiskers .\nD : briefly , it's supposed to be seal .\nD : you can imagine it in the water .\nD : like them , because they are like playful and silly have good time .\nD : not gonna try and pretend like get any better than that .\nA : i'm rose and i'm project manager , from california .\nA : it's actually coyote .\nD : it's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it .\nA : let's see , let's give it little bit of snout , , some teeth .\nB : that's that's pretty impressive .\nA : live live across the street from an open space in california .\nA : we have coyotes howl all the time .\nA : so really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals .\nA : moving on to slightly more serious .\nA : we're gonna talk about project finances .\nA : we have couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of fifteen million euro from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's we have market range of internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics .\nA : in order to make profit of this magnitude , we need to be able to produce each one at maximum of twelve fifty euro .\nA : so we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for .\nA : just to generate little bit of discussion about the project , could i'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , your first ideas about creating new remote control , what would be the best like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so .\nD : hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t_v_ like you have to do one for the power of the t_v_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , .\nD : now they keep combining all different remotes together , and if necessarily like that 'cause feel like you end up with multimedia overload .\nD : wanna watch the t_v_ .\nD : always gets lost .\nD : some like device to help you find it .\nC : i've used , i've used remote controls , for things like t_v_ and the c_d_ player and video recorder and they're they're pretty neat neat little tools .\nC : you don't have to get up and walk across the room to change channel .\nC : so especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty .\nC : find them they can be bit annoying , especially , like if i'm watching t_v_ have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , , one for the t_v_ , one for the digital box , one for the video recorder as .\nC : and also they tend to they tend to be bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them too too too complicated when all really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .\nB : agree with having too many remotes around .\nB : my dad has whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and how to work half of them .\nB : what's important for me , , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you need to to you're doing .\nB : and one thing particularly like is if you are not moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red .\nB : there is way around that , but my residence now the the television you have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so it's just simpler just to just turn around the t_v_ itself , and that's if we're gonna make remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing .\nD : what about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?\nA : would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like lithium battery that would last lot longer than like double a_s .\nB : something that doesn't .\nA : like tho those are the batteries that are used in lot of m_p_ three players now and that thing .\nA : it seems we have little bit of conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having five different remotes .\nA : so like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes .\nA : so how do we work with that ?\nB : could we get something that just has no doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program other things that i'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , volume control , on , off , channel changing .\nD : and that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the t_v_ on that's , , like the top thing on the remote , if be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the t_v_ was here , then all the v_c_r_ was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 'cause then you like , don't even i'm turning on .\nB : and if if you'd save the more complicated functions for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .\nA : so have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .\nA : because that is one thing that remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v_s no longer have as .\nA : so like you have to have them somewhere , 'cause you're gonna need those special functions occasionally .\nA : but not necessarily on the the normal remote .\nC : can ask , are we designing remote control for television only , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?\nC : or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ?\nA : it's good question .\nA : i'll look into that .\nD : it's just t_v_ , , if it if we're taking it just new product new television remote control that's not like doesn't say .\nD : things might be more advanced than that .\nC : so we should we should assume that it's just television that we're wanting to control .\nC : suppose it would be to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as if that works technologically or not .\nB : we have to define what what we're aiming for .\nB : if it's just television then that it's bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it .\nD : it's an idea with the buttons being really .\nB : if you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .\nA : sounds like we've had good little discussion for our first ideas .\nA : mind if we move on ?\nA : now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes .\nA : believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like , but this is just breakdown of what we'll be doing individually .\nA : the industrial design , alima will be doing the working design .\nA : the user interface designer , that's for .\nA : technical functions , like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons .\nA : user requirements , so you'll be hearing about different trends , about different things that people need , the same discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum consumers .\nA : and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach .\nA : realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get little brain-storming done .\nA : so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful artists we all are .\nC : what we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ?\nC : do we know that ?\nA : haven't gotten an agenda yet , i'll put that together .\nA : i'm as we'll each get our own instruction and then because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together .\nA : so i'm we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time i'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you .\nB : i'm we'll be busy .\nA : just including all the things that we talked about .\nC : can you e-mail your slides as ?\nC : is that possible ?\nA : yes , yes , .\nA : i'll just attach it to an email .\nA : and you're you're number two , three , four ?\nA : is that correct ?\nA : it was lovely meeting you all .\nA : just make you keep checking the company web site and the emails .\nA : let me see if do that now ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda. </t>  <t> The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of the appearance and use of remotes, finding that users

all again .\nA : let's see if that comes up .\nA : this is our functional design meeting .\nA : just sec while my powerpoint comes up .\nA : we put the fashion in electronics .\nA : our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen .\nA : i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ?\nA : e-mailed them to you .\nA : i'm also putting them in the shared folder .\nA : so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations .\nA : i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions .\nA : finally we'll just close .\nA : we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes .\nA : so first of all the functional design objectives .\nA : we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .\nA : three presentations , you can go in any order you choose .\nD : shall we go in the order that you just did it ?\nD : how do hook my screen up ?\nB : you might have to disconnect rose .\nC : there's wee wee plug just just that one there that's it , .\nD : where does it go ?\nD : i'm not supposed to move this , but where's function ?\nC : and then you have to press function eight it is on your laptop .\nA : function , eight , .\nA : the blue one , f_n_ .\nA : is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and .\nD : , 's screw in .\nB : you just have to push it in really hard .\nD : push the screw .\nD : alright i've never attached to anything .\nA : it's taking it little bit there you go .\nD : alright , so , if you are able to get access to the report that was online or if i'm the only one who is .\nD : but , don't even know how to play this .\nA : press the little presentation .\nA : it's the it looks like y_ over there above draw .\nA : there , that one , there you go .\nD : so we're just gonna talk little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked .\nD : real reaction did some market research .\nD : they had hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch t_v_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .\nD : what they found was they analysed people's desires and needs .\nD : focusing on their desires , people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for fancier looking remote .\nD : anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , .\nD : also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .\nD : people also had certain frustrations , that that we could try to take into consideration with our design .\nD : that being people frustrated with losing their remotes .\nD : over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration .\nD : people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use remote and that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use .\nD : it also mentioned something called r_s_i_ and was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r_s_i_ is , because .\nC : repetitive strain injury .\nC : repetitive strain injury .\nD : there we go .\nC : so if you cheers .\nD : people do not like that .\nD : so the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , the repetitive use , , caused strain .\nD : looking at the needs people specified , the problem now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour .\nD : people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .\nD : and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume .\nD : people also zap like to change the channel , about sixty five per cent during an hour of use .\nD : so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on .\nD : so that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so that's coming to me later , like that .\nD : but something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make that , , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used lot more often .\nD : and in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that .\nA : that was that was .\nA : 's move on to the next presentation on effects .\nA : was that you ?\nD : have unscrewed it ?\nA : user interface , .\nD : here we go .\nD : and that's in the shared , if did it , if anyone wants to look at it .\nC : here we go .\nC : so i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control .\nC : we need to start by considering what remote control actually is .\nC : it's device thows us to produce certain effects on our television , so it's communication device .\nC : we we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness .\nC : how do we actually go about designing new television remote control ?\nC : first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications .\nC : we need to our final product is gonna be like , so we need clear idea of exactly what this product does , how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product .\nC : way i'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , and then trying to get some feedback about how these particular prototypes work , sorta find out what people think of .\nC : using remote control is is quite subjective experience .\nC : and different different people prefer different things .\nC : we should remember that remote controls are fairly standard piece of equipment .\nC : when users using remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places .\nC : so in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for device which is fairly conventional in design so that we're not completely shocking people .\nC : but within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas and to make something that's that's perhaps little bit different , something that stands out .\nC : also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities .\nC : the first of these is is technological ye what can we do with the current state of technology as it is .\nC : the second is is economic , we need to find balance between features and price .\nC : so as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price but it would also im improve the design of the product .\nC : so had look on the on the web to see if could find few examples of existing television remote controls .\nC : in analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , what things do they get , what's bad about them , what's wrong with , how we can improve on the designs that that that found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls .\nC : here's two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .\nC : on the left here we've got an engineering-based design for remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , freeze frame .\nC : it's it's fully featured and it might take while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your t_v_ .\nC : the one on the is lot more basic .\nC : it's just got the essential functions of the t_v_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume .\nC : it would be lot quicker to learn to use it , but again it's it's swings and roundabouts .\nC : there are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture .\nC : there's lot of features that are missing from that remote control .\nC : so we've got to to find our find way of striking balance between the two .\nC : as said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things .\nC : personally wa what want from remote control is device that's simple , it it's easy to use , it's got big buttons for doing the things do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel .\nC : it it does everything that need it to , as said before , i'm quite lazy , don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television .\nC : also want something that that looks , and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed .\nA : that was very useful .\nA : it's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes .\nA : and neither of them were very pretty , ?\nB : that could be our selling point .\nD : fashion fashion remote .\nC : there's there's certainly market for technology that looks .\nC : and that's that's why companies like apple've 've 've made lot of progress .\nB : really can't see what i'm doing , so does anyone have ah-ha , look at that , showing up already .\nA : you there it is .\nD : so , did it let you go on the internet or was that just what it let you see ?\nC : that was just on the on the company web site , .\nD : 'cause was like googling and then i'm like it won't let me google .\nB : alright no , how do play again ?\nA : the it's above draw .\nA : there are three thingy if it's way at the bottom .\nA : under three icons and it's the one that looks like desk .\nA : there are y_s .\nB : so this is our working design presentation .\nB : had bit of some issues with this , because wasn't able to find everything needed , but that's we're still in early stages .\nB : so , , this is this .\nB : though the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .\nB : one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that coffee grinder .\nB : it works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work .\nB : if i'm explaining that very , but how do get to the next .\nB : so the method as working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done .\nB : so wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen .\nB : so you make schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function .\nB : and then the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately .\nA : you just press , just click .\nA : that'll be fine .\nB : so the findings that got very just very briefly is that you have choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need sight line .\nB : so that's one thing we're gonna work on .\nB : the user interface is critical here , because lot of the things that happen in remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that ian is designing , is gonna be crucial .\nB : and really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design .\nB : so the components that we find here are the energy source , the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver .\nB : so you have four main components and they are designed like this .\nB : you have your energy source there which then brings energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users .\nB : you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip 's not what wanted to do .\nA : use that thing you can go back , previous .\nB : about that , .\nB : no , no , no , no , no .\nB : let's just get back to my schematic here .\nA : ye double click on it .\nA : with the with the left hand one .\nB : don't show me that tip again .\nA : there we are .\nB : there we are .\nB : about this , .\nB : i'm pathetic with things like this .\nB : so you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver .\nB : so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my garbled way .\nB : this is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out .\nB : and personal preferences , besides the fact that 't spell , we need long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it lot .\nB : we need chip that works with the user interface , that isn't too complicated .\nB : we need straightforward interface , like ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands .\nB : so that's it for the working design .\nB : rose , do you think you can give me hand with this ?\nA : never tell which way to turn these things .\nA : lefty loosey , righty tighty , ?\nA : lefty loosey , righty tighty .\nC : never heard that before , that's good .\nC : i'll think of that every time now .\nB : it's gonna stick in your head .\nD : that's good one it'll stick with you .\nA : have nothing on my screen .\nA : here we are .\nA : , it's fine .\nA : we have couple new requirements that was just e-mailed before the meeting and that we have to keep in in in mind as we're creating this .\nA : we didn't bring it up yet , or in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about we're not gonna worry about that .\nB : it's british thing .\nC : you don't have it in the states ?\nA : could would you care to explain it ?\nC : it's like suppose it's similar to very very basic web browser .\nC : you have like you have numbers on your remote control , and you type in the page number you want , so like you type hundred on your remote control and this this index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it .\nC : and you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring like what's on t_v_ next and share prices and that thing .\nB : lottery numbers and sport scores .\nB : but if you ever see the t_v_ saying like go to page one sixty on ceefax now , that's what they're talking about .\nC : it's earl it's pretty old technology .\nC : it's like nineteen eighties .\nD : that explains lot .\nB : have no idea why we don't have it , but .\nA : , we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that .\nA : and we're also gonna like your question earlier whether this is going to be for television , video , or etcetera .\nA : just for television .\nA : that's what we're focused on .\nA : otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out very quickly .\nA : we only have short amount of time .\nA : and finally there's more marketing , , , our corporate image has to be recognisable .\nA : so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan in the new design .\nC : so what's our corporate image like ?\nC : it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics .\nA : looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in .\nC : it's like double .\nA : but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics .\nA : so we gotta keep that in that in mind .\nB : so we want something that looks good and is yellow .\nA : or ha some buttons could be yellow .\nA : like , we can we can play around with it little bit .\nA : we need to talk about our functions and our target group .\nA : we need to decide who our target group is .\nA : you in your analysis of different market of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , that that older people didn't really care for voice recognition , but younger people did .\nA : and so who are we aiming this at ?\nB : we're gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , , younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this .\nD : yes , do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?\nA : it's gonna be twenty five euro remember , so it has to be avai marketable to whomever it is .\nC : is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes with television ?\nC : 'cause that would affect the way that we market it .\nA : at least now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five euro by itself .\nD : the only break-down that was given in terms of age was the voice activation and there's big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like fifteen to thirty five that think that that's good idea .\nD : i'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .\nB : that's probably population quite little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be fairly good target group for us .\nA : now , those are that's all specific for speech recognition .\nA : are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?\nC : would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price .\nC : especially if we are marketing it as separate product , people are gonna be paying , , we've got price limit of was it twelve twelve and half euros for to produce it ?\nB : to produce it , .\nA : to produce it , yes .\nC : and wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and half euros without having to make too many other compromises .\nD : but what else are we gonna put , not that i'm really gung-ho about it , what else you can put in remote to make it technologically advanced though .\nD : so like other than just making it look good , how is it it can look really and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy new remote ?\nB : but why are we why are we aiming for technological advancement ?\nB : everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , it could use it could mean , not .\nA : that's good thing to keep in mind .\nB : if they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .\nD : if someone's looking to buy new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ?\nA : we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at user-friendly .\nA : simplification , so , .\nB : they could have crap remote that came with their t_v_ that's just impossible to use , or it broke , or they're just missing it .\nA : and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or pull out of the side .\nD : can you like this may be too complicated , but , wish had something to explain it , like if it was just simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in .\nC : the remote there are remote controls like that , .\nD : do what i'm saying ?\nC : like some t_v_s they have sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons .\nC : so if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons .\nD : 'cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out .\nD : and you're happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones , but 's all still in one .\nB : that's good idea .\nC : that's good idea , .\nA : we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede the chip transmitting information , but that's gonna be mostly technological thing .\nA : so what are we emphasising ?\nA : what in this project ?\nC : si simplicity and fashion .\nD : simplicity , fashion .\nA : simplicity and fashion .\nA : those are very good goals , , that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do .\nA : simplicity and fashion and , , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around lot .\nD : what can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ?\nD : i'm just wondering .\nA : it's lot to do with battery , but that's just my .\nB : the battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents it , without scattering .\nD : so 's just the quality of the chip .\nB : the quality quality of all the components really , , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's gonna be visible down the line .\nA : so our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?\nD : how useful that number is if we're not doing .\nA : voice recognition , which feel like voice recognition is not necessary in remote control , like it might be necessary for t_v_ but not for the remote , .\nC : it's , , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech .\nA : seems little bit .\nA : and it might be too expensive .\nD : and if the whole idea is you're using remote then why would you have voice , like what and then it's like you wouldn't need remote you'd just talk to your t_v_ .\nC : it's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote .\nD : if get more numbers , i'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages .\nD : but this doesn't divide up anything and there was only hundred subjects also , which isn't , , really isn't that representative , especially if it's hundred subjects that they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so twenty to like fifty five .\nB : but regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five .\nA : under sixty five , , that's good start .\nA : i'd say we're can we narrow it down to teenagers and families ?\nA : 'cause that would go up to like fifty ?\nB : or like single professionals .\nA : single it's it's hard to narrow it down .\nB : it's really hard to figure out now .\nC : the product appeals across quite broad range of ages .\nC : we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , people who have problems with technology , , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people , but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people .\nD : we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , we can define it by like the demographic of like how much money they have to spend like that , like , it has to be someone who owns television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that thing .\nC : aim for an income group .\nB : that's good point .\nA : so it's more useful to to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because , , things so different will appeal to different people , but .\nA : there're couple functions do we want something so that do we want some thing to find it if it's lost ?\nA : like button on t_v_ you can press and it'll ring , like or beep ?\nD : like said before , fifty per cent of of the fru like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it .\nD : and if we're talking about making something easy that goes along with it so it wouldn't be like random thing to add in .\nD : it would be relevant to like the overall goal , so .\nB : that'll probably be good .\nA : we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions .\nA : so let's do that quickly .\nA : so we want something to keep it from getting lost .\nA : and we want we want large buttons for the essential things .\nA : large , accessible buttons for the essentials .\nA : we want possibility to to get possibility to get the extra functions .\nC : which are hidden away in some way or not hidden but they're they're not as prominent as the main features .\nA : , hidden way .\nA : and we also want it to be fashionable , which i'm not if that's function so much as .\nD : on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that thing .\nA : any other essential functions that we need ?\nA : do we need long-life battery ?\nB : battery battery use .\nB : but that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really .\nA : but we might as .\nD : so you never have to change the battery .\nC : we should investigate whether it needs battery .\nC : suspect the remote control does need battery , but if you can .\nA : just 'cause it is an electronic device , the charging .\nB : it it does .\nB : don't don't think of way you can operate chip and convert that much data without without one .\nC : without the energy , .\nB : but you could have it in little charging station like mobile phone , or like little cradle for your ipod .\nC : that's that's possible .\nB : you could we could do that instead .\nB : so you don't ha you got like rechargeable battery .\nB : that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place .\nA : we have to think about space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're , would you put it on top of the t_v_ ?\nA : just think , that's that's good idea , we'll keep it .\nA : t's and fun .\nB : that's just off the top of my head .\nA : we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions and .\nA : after the meeting we're gonna each complete sks questionnaire and summaries summary .\nA : and then we'll have our lunch break .\nA : after that we have thirty minutes of individual work .\nA : i'll make to put up the minutes and the project documentation and including these powerpoint slides .\nA : if everyone could do that as , that'd be .\nA : you each have individual actions , i_d_ industrial design you've your components concept , user interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching .\nA : and as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you .\nA : and hopefully , hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could .\nA : it's kinda frustrating , but be to note any frustrations or any issues that come up in your in your summary .\nD : did you were you able to like put yours in the group folder ?\nB : yes , did that .\nB : hopefully it is there for people .\nA : looks like there are looks like there's second one of mine that's that didn't do , it's from like an earlier project , so under the shared folder , it might not even be under yours as .\nD : where is that ?\nD : yours is only have three , have like our three .\nB : so in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements .\nB : at least that's what have in .\nB : that's what have as , rose so .\nA : you don't have mine ?\nD : no , but that's 'cause yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server .\nD : but if open it and then save it , probably will be there .\nD : never mind you can't save it to the .\nA : 'll figure that out in the meantime ."], ["<t>

</t> ", "A : time is it ?\nD : fourteen twenty six .\nA : lovely to see you all again .\nA : it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock .\nA : our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close .\nA : these are our minutes from the functional design .\nA : we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it .\nA : our main objectives were simplicity and fashion .\nA : and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station .\nA : now three presentations .\nA : i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching .\nB : that would be me .\nA : function eight it .\nA : there we go .\nB : i'm very excited by this one actually had lot of fun doing it .\nB : this is where you look at what does it take to make remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of .\nB : so , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as whole .\nB : the main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery .\nB : these are all things that we had addressed before , but i'm gonna take each one little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like .\nB : the case , the options that i've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , there's there's the shape of case , we could do flat sh flat case , curved case or even double double-curved case .\nB : haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the the main base will be plastic , but we have all these fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .\nB : that would be our case .\nB : buttons , for buttons we have pushbuttons , which is what real reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an l_ screen .\nB : circuit board and chip we can have simple one , regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are .\nB : and then battery is where things get most exciting .\nB : we're talking about long-life batteries here .\nB : we can we can have your basic double batteries , but we also have these options of using kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it little bit to get it to power up .\nB : so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery .\nB : or solar battery , although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we can't use latex case if we have solar battery .\nB : or something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights .\nB : not quite what that is , but that's the description that received , so that's what i'm passing on to you .\nB : so those are our options .\nB : personal preferences that was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity .\nB : so if we're going for fashion in our cases , that what we're gonna wanna look at is curved or double-curved case , probably with variety of design elements .\nB : titanium , some wood .\nB : we're gonna have to investigate that better when get specifics of the actual materials , but that's what have in mind .\nB : and we wanna go for simplicity .\nB : probably pushbuttons , but i'm intrigued by the idea of scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything any ideas on that ?\nB : know the ipods and things now have touch scroll buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into .\nB : and i'm really intrigued by the idea of kinetic battery .\nB : solar don't think would be such good idea , because how often are you that your remote control will get certain amount of light .\nB : but this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that simple just shaking it around will make it work , that that would be very interesting thing .\nB : but we'd also wanna go for simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down .\nB : we really only need regular or advanced chip if we're gonna start using an .\nB : so we want to be aware of not making things overly technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down .\nB : that's what have for options .\nB : i'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what i'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing .\nD : is double-curved like would be like two hands thing ?\nB : haven't received any specific visuals of this yet .\nD : 'cause i'm imagining like double-curved is like , , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like single vertical-ish looking thing , but i've no idea .\nB : this is what i'm .\nB : i'm not , but i'll let as soon as get any pictures .\nB : we do have double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it .\nB : but the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting .\nB : just all things to keep in mind .\nA : just an interesting marketing element .\nB : that's about all have to do , .\nB : hope didn't go through that too quickly .\nA : just real quick question the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , .\nB : no idea , no idea .\nB : i'm assuming that kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that tita titanium is very light , know , but other than that's really basic , , that's all have gotten so far .\nB : any other questions ?\nB : have save this in the shared projects , if anyone wants to look and have considerable notes on the topic as , if anyone needs any more information .\nB : just in my notebook , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me .\nA : if you made notes yourself you can put those on our underneath our , in your book , then don't worry about that .\nA : now we're concepts concepts of user interface .\nA : this one's so much tighter than the other one .\nA : there we go .\nA : here you are .\nC : alright , so i'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .\nC : we've talked about the two essential properties of the user interface .\nC : we want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable .\nC : other we've also got to remember that this is device that serves as useful purpose .\nC : we want people to be able to use it as remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the of the device are and make that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with device that is going to be useful to people .\nC : we have number of different choices for design concept and that's that's something that that i'll show you some examples of , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how what model is there going to be for user interaction with this device .\nC : once we've chosen concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features .\nC : and we also have to make it look .\nC : so , that's what we don't want .\nC : we don't want lots of buttons , complicated features .\nC : we want something that looks and simple .\nC : here's fairly simple device .\nC : this is an an ipod from apple .\nC : the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons .\nC : it's very minimalistic in its design .\nC : you use these four buttons to to move around range of settings on the small screen .\nC : the thing like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features .\nC : you can just about make out that the button three buttons are previous track , next track and play pause .\nC : they're the main the main features of the ipod , the things you will use all the time .\nC : then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want .\nC : so that's that's good good model that we could have .\nC : here's another example .\nC : this is it's an interesting idea and it looks pretty .\nC : it's certainly got novelty value .\nC : it's and colourful , it's and bright .\nC : it's also something that you can feel your way around .\nC : the buttons are are different shapes and and you can if you're watching t_v_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and , it's ith it's fun .\nC : so like like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often .\nC : so you'd need few buttons to select your favourite channels .\nC : most people , when they watch t_v_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their t_v_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most .\nC : so , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching t_v_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored .\nC : other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the t_v_ , what else you do with t_v_ .\nC : but these are these are all necessary functions .\nC : you can't have there's no point having television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find way of including these somehow .\nC : and one other suggestions i'd make is to in is to include in menu system , bit like on the ipod .\nC : so we'd either have small display on the device itself , or have dis menu display that comes up on your television and can be controlled through the device .\nC : and that would allow you to access access the advanced features whilst keeping very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .\nB : so you'd be advocating an then ?\nC : that's that's one way to go , yes .\nC : there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an display , it's it's , because it's it it lets you just sit there and st and control your television from your armchair .\nC : there are disadvantages , an an display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're 're assume we're gonna be making quite small device .\nC : it would also have to have backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch t_v_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your l_d_d_ display .\nC : the alternative is to have an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control .\nC : bit like bit like how they have these digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel .\nC : that that's also good idea .\nC : it's it can it does have it's problems as , if you've got small t_v_ and you're sitting on the other side of room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up .\nC : but that's that's design decision that we can make .\nA : do think that one of the important features for remote is seeing menu and seeing what's on .\nA : and so like favourite channels is is applicable , but that you do need to have some function where it's you have you can see the title of the show or possibly description of it .\nB : are you are you tak .\nA : like use that often enough .\nD : but is that separate from what he was saying ?\nA : it if it was l_ on on the remote , that you could that you'd be able to see .\nB : no , we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v_c_r_ if i've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on .\nC : that that would be one of the features , yes .\nC : but it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put display on the remote control the communication is one way , so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least don't think you can .\nA : 'cause that would be more specifically digital box , .\nA : now we're moving on to market .\nD : should plug that in ?\nC : is that going on ?\nD : it's just not is it on ?\nC : that should be alright , actually .\nD : ri what do you have to press , five ?\nD : keep pressing lots of .\nD : how relevant all of this gonna be .\nD : if anything , the that they gave me .\nA : it's not plugged in , quite in enough .\nA : there we are .\nB : there we go .\nD : so we're gonna look little bit at trend watching .\nD : was given an executive summary that was market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year .\nD : so first they had people they ranked the important aspects of remote controls , and now they're saying that currently there's functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel .\nD : and as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account .\nD : the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations .\nD : that would be like if we use something like the space material or the screen , things like that .\nD : and then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this .\nD : how much we agree with that .\nD : and then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's preference for spongy , tight material .\nD : and so that brings us to my personal preferences .\nD : who wants spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding .\nD : personally , don't really think that want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , in year , so even though this is coming from us as , , trend watch , market research , how much of it we necessarily wanna take away .\nD : also , considering that the research has been carried out by real reaction , i'm little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology edas ease of use is necessarily the ranking .\nD : personally , like might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most .\nD : but it doesn't necessarily need to be spongy material .\nB : that there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though .\nD : don't have lot of notes to share if you want them , that sums it up .\nA : do we have any some questions for this , let's see .\nD : what can possibly enlighten on ?\nA : do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ?\nA : how to how to use fruit or vegetable or or the spongy material ?\nA : like could we make like could we make spongy remote ?\nA : it would be easier on the hands .\nB : if it's latex if it's latexy , mean an if my understanding of latex case is that it's hard to protect inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands .\nA : it's and then it we would have to find way to protect like the chip and all that , .\nB : it's there's something to be said , we we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to repetitive stress injuries and things and and , something grippable , we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , .\nD : so something , instead of necess , grip , i'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , , and i'm envisioning more like , , the material that you have when you sit on like bicycle , so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for long time , like i'm imagining that thing , what that material's called .\nB : that given the list of materials was forwarded it's that seems doable .\nB : could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ?\nB : we could colour-co-ordinate them , li the buttons could be fruit-shaped .\nA : for , or like couple main ones being like , , lemons or strawberries .\nA : could they be smelly ?\nC : is it supposed to be shaped like vegetable ?\nB : t's quite easy to shape thing like carrot isn't it ?\nC : like , like carrots .\nA : or carrot shaped , .\nC : or like potato .\nB : or the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .\nA : like large button , that's what was thinking of , .\nD : what about the idea of like round remote ?\nD : instead of like vertical up and down one .\nD : like in terms of holding it .\nD : like that's shape of fruit .\nB : it'd be harder to bu buttons .\nD : just to tie it in little .\nA : might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ?\nA : 'cause the reason they're long is .\nB : it'd be harder to press button .\nA : harder to push .\nC : when you when you use remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ?\nC : or your fingers ?\nB : that's ts how tend to do it .\nA : usually hold it in one hand .\nA : but then the buttons would have to be very small .\nC : or you want something that's shaped like mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb .\nD : 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around .\nA : don't you think ?\nB : no just thumb-sized .\nD : but like love the idea of the wheel like the ipod .\nA : but in order to get to all of them , .\nA : they would have to be within certain amount of space with each other .\nC : but if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much problem , perhaps .\nB : when i'm when i'm pressing buttons on my ipod , that's how do it , hold it and press the four .\nC : so you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and and you find that works quite ?\nB : or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel .\nB : it wel , it would each version of it has been little bit different , but , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore .\nC : is that the button on an ipod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like scroll thing ?\nD : 'cause it's like five , 'cause there's one in the middle .\nA : it's scroll , , it's wheel .\nA : the one have doesn't have the four on like around it , don't think .\nB : ts and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button there .\nC : see , , .\nB : since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , .\nC : that's quite good design .\nD : why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume .\nD : like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual t_v_ .\nD : am wanting to say on the t_v_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , ?\nD : and then you could still have that available .\nB : an screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .\nC : it could be difficult in practice , .\nC : also , 'cause you would be looking down at the screen , than back up at your t_v_ and people don't wanna do that .\nB : we probably have to get going , don't we ?\nA : we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so i'm i'm gonna continue with my pres presentation .\nA : i've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so i'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on .\nA : and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium .\nD : if get any more information of fruits and vegetables , i'll let .\nB : could could we could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ?\nC : like , to make it different fruits .\nB : in different fruit and vegetable colours , .\nB : and you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever .\nC : the packaging , it should be like lemon and the the packaging is like the peel .\nB : all these options .\nC : so instead of opening the box you just peel it , and the remote control's inside .\nD : there we go .\nD : the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun .\nD : it's like the way it all comes all cute .\nA : energy , chip on print .\nB : uh-hu , yes .\nB : had skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but alright , so decisions , what the deci decisions on energy i'm thinking is based on the battery .\nA : that's this is the agenda they gave me .\nA : so can you just explain what that is real quick ?\nB : what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?\nD : , it would take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries .\nC : it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the how reliable it is , but as far as know , the technology is good .\nB : haven't gotten any , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than regular battery , but but if we're using an cheaper chip , then it'll even out , .\nD : but over time , it's but if you if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker looking .\nB : got whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced .\nB : they're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us .\nB : don't really to tell you as far as decisions .\nB : wasn't really given any options , was just given that this is how they're done .\nB : 't can't really tell you .\nB : tell you whole lot about how it works .\nB : but any decisions on .\nA : if they're if they're really options .\nB : i'm , did .\nC : al all circuit boards are the same , .\nC : it's fairly fairly standard .\nA : then we'll move on to the case .\nA : bu if we decided on like simple , regular , or an advanced chip , .\nB : here's the here's the thing on the chips that that got .\nB : simple , regular , advanced chip on print .\nB : the chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that .\nB : , the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require simple chip , but scroll wheel requires regular chip , and an requires advanced .\nB : do we want scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ?\nC : don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel .\nC : it might be for changing the volume .\nA : it would be for changing the volume , but how useful it'd be for changing the channel .\nC : but don't would really work .\nA : 'cause you don't have control over numbers or we have five minutes left for the meeting , so .\nC : you really need buttons for changing channel .\nB : it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .\nD : and otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , , black with red sticking out and no it's gonna inevitably start looking like those group of ugly ones that we saw stacked up .\nA : so , have scroll for volume ?\nB : or for all those secret functions ?\nB : when you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have scroll wheel to go through those menus .\nC : scroll wheel would be , but it's not necessary .\nB : so we could either go with simple or regular chip , depending and we could table that decision for later .\nA : when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide whether we're gonna have scroll or not .\nB : let's think about that while we talk about the case .\nA : let's do case .\nB : i'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing .\nA : i'm little i'm little hesitant about it , because i'm worried about protecting the on the inside .\nA : would be more with like titanium actual thing and then like mobile phone thing .\nD : could it be hard , and then something around it ?\nB : everything i've wha what i've what i've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's like hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex .\nB : not too thick layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that .\nB : the inside is hard .\nB : don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , that that's done for us .\nA : so we we do want latex .\nA : and probably in colours , fruity , vegetable colours .\nA : let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip suppose .\nB : and we want curved case , ?\nA : we don't really the difference is , ?\nD : i'm thinking curved of some sort .\nB : we don't really the difference good point .\nA : interface , the type and the supplements .\nA : so push or scroll , ?\nC : and if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is scroll button .\nC : so in terms of in terms of economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons .\nA : and if we had sc an on-screen thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things .\nC : , it's it's it's fairly simple .\nA : for channel surfing scroll an actual like an ipod's scroll thing would be too fast , .\nB : say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but have no idea how much more expensive scroll wheel is than than pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so it might be better to put our money into the like the kinetic battery and the case because .\nA : is that with you ?\nA : how you feeling ?\nD : and let's like see if we get anything else .\nD : i'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it different look , but if it's gonna be in latex type thing and that's gonna look , then that's probably gonna have bigger impact than the scroll wheel .\nA : it might be enough .\nA : so we're gonna go with type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ?\nC : what do you mean by supplements , exactly ?\nA : assume that's what else we're gonna like ha the the additional buttons we can use .\nA : so we're gonna have like menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ?\nA : so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through .\nB : so what are what are our buttons gonna be ?\nB : on off so like one through five , or no .\nC : on off , volume , favourite channels , and menu .\nC : about like , bit like radio presets .\nD : like radio type sorta situation ?\nC : we wouldn't even need the numbers .\nA : pre-set channels and then we're gonna need numbers one through zero , ?\nC : numbers seems is old-fashioned .\nA : but in order to pre-set cha you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through .\nC : , you can just and you need some , , up down button , but the volume control could double for that , .\nA : finishing the meeting now .\nA : our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on prototype using modelling clay .\nA : you'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .\nA : did we decide on chip ?\nA : let's go with simple chip ?\nA : we are done .\nA : di these are already in our shared folder , so .\nC : wasn't expecting that ."], ["<t> The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. </t>  <t> The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. </t>  <t> The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. </t>  <t> They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. </t>  <t> The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. </t>  <t> The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project, the information they found and used, their creativity, their teamwork, and the materials they had at their disposal. </t>  <t> The team was generally quite satisfied. </t>  <t> After the project manager's closing, the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes. </t>  <t> They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will resemble the potato prototype. </t>  <t> There will be no feature to help find the remote when it is misplaced; instead the remote will be in a bright color to address this issue. </t>  <t> The corporate logo will be on the remote. </t>  <t> One of the color concepts for the remote will contain the corporate colors. </t>  <t> The remote will have six buttons. </t>  <t> The buttons will all be one color. </t>  <t> The case will be single curve. </t>  <t> The case will be made of rubber. </t>  <t> The case will have a special color. </t>  <t> Whether or not to have a feature which helps find the remote when it is misplaced. </t> ", "A : welcome to our detailed design meeting .\nA : i'm pretty excited .\nA : let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that .\nA : the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria .\nA : we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close .\nA : so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .\nA : and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels .\nA : let's do the look and feel design presentation first .\nC : do you wanna start ?\nB : made three different prototypes and we'll start with with this one .\nB : we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape .\nB : it's you hold it either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand .\nB : you can push the buttons with your thumb like mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even there's whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger .\nB : we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big .\nB : we have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here .\nB : if you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if the volume buttons rather .\nB : if you press select once , they become channel changing buttons .\nB : if we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your t_v_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here .\nB : if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand .\nB : that's our number one prototype .\nB : do you wanna present the potato , or shall present the martian ?\nA : like little lightning in it .\nC : what we call that one the rhombus , the rhombus .\nA : the little lightning bolt in it , very cute .\nD : could could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as power button ?\nA : the the rhombus rhombus ?\nB : that's the rhombus , .\nC : this one is known as the potato , it's it's how can present it ?\nC : it's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely .\nC : it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your hand .\nC : i've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one .\nC : the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume .\nC : so you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here .\nC : the red ones are for changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's moves between your favourite channels that you've selected .\nC : this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button to select and that's it , that's the potato .\nA : on , off ?\nC : that would be one of your channels , , so like channel zero would be to switch switch the machine off , .\nA : we turn it off .\nC : not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your t_v_ off .\nB : if you pressed and held it .\nC : that that'd be one way of doing it , .\nD : if you like held it down , that would be on off .\nC : that'd work , .\nB : on off , that's possibility , .\nB : and then finally we have the martian or the pear , either way .\nB : it's bit different , just little bit more of creative feel .\nB : you have the on off toggle stem on the top .\nB : we have the five preset seeds .\nB : and then you have on the sides to make it little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button here in the middle .\nB : so , that's for your consideration as , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up .\nB : we figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if made the bot the bottom flat .\nD : what's the yellow one in the middle , forgot .\nB : the menu select button .\nA : that one's my favourite .\nC : so that's so that's our three prototypes .\nC : in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on form which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put brand name or or logo on it or whatever .\nB : we were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but we're also thinking that your middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want fruity coloured remote , so we'd have one version that's bit toned down , with with less contrasts on it .\nB : something still little bright to make it hard to lose , but .\nC : would , but we don't want it to look like kids' toy .\nA : now that was one thing that we brought up over email .\nA : if you picked up your email , but the the feature that we considered for it not getting lost .\nB : were we were talking about that little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house .\nB : it's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen .\nB : so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss .\nD : but if it's like under covers or like in couch you still can't see it .\nA : it's really would it be very difficult to just have an external device that like , you tape to your to your t_v_ that when you press it you ha little light beep goes off ?\nA : do you think that would be conceptually possible ?\nC : it would be difficult technologically , because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , so it's i'm not quite how it would work and then wonder if it's if it's more just gimmick then anything else .\nA : that's true , .\nC : ho how many times do you really , lose your remote control and would would device like that actually help you to find it ?\nB : there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make noise , but it would take lot more development than we have this afternoon .\nA : that's fair evaluation .\nA : we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now .\nA : 'cause , the designs are very bright , so you're , they're gonna stick out , but .\nB : so do people have preference as far as feel and functionality ?\nD : feel like this is simil or it's what already exists so if we're trying to think of something like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init i'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different .\nD : like this one , like why , it just it's like small but still like cute looking , .\nD : but also like the the side buttons on that one , like that's neat .\nD : but how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , looking thing that we also need to focus on .\nA : could we have like an extra button on the top for on off ?\nA : so then we wouldn't have to have like dual function ?\nB : that's good , that's good .\nD : there we go .\nC : it's possible , , .\nB : here , stick it on .\nC : put an extra the button on .\nA : why don't we do product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ?\nD : do we like we're supposed to have one that we do it for .\nD : that was was little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do , but let me have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .\nA : do you need this or just write on the white board ?\nD : no , actually don't have like powerpointy thing , 'cause it would be redundant .\nA : it's like like joystick thing , , kinda push it .\nA : little smaller than that .\nB : no , kinda like it .\nB : that's hard to miss .\nC : it makes look more fruity as .\nA : it does , it's like there it could have stem like that , 'cause do like the stem .\nC : it's like deformed foot , .\nA : it almost helps you ge keep grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers .\nA : like this one .\nB : is that where people are leaning then , the potato ?\nA : variety of colours are .\nB : like the idea of the that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .\nA : i'm leaning towards the potato .\nA : am worried about like using menu .\nA : in that like withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?\nB : that on the ipod , , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .\nA : but that has menu button separate from select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ?\nC : this is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for list of choices .\nC : you find the choice that you want and you press you press the button .\nA : could these be used for going to submenus or .\nC : so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , .\nB : it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level .\nA : as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , .\nD : so which one are we roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our necessities , the yellowy one is that , can change it after we go through each different one .\nB : are we leaning towards the potato ?\nD : so what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to .\nD : so what we wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then i'll tabulate an average just to make that it does meet that .\nD : so we'll just go through them one at time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria .\nD : so we can do this one first .\nD : first we wanna it meets the fancy look and feel objective .\nD : so like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i'm gonna say it's like three .\nD : that's just my opinion .\nD : what does each of you , give it number , .\nA : t's it's unique enough that i'd give it one or two .\nA : will give it one .\nB : if it's it's creative .\nB : if fancy is the word would use .\nB : if any of them are fancy in i'd say two , because unique .\nD : and two , awesome .\nC : i'll go for two .\nD : alright , and same scale for functionality , is it functional ?\nD : it's extremely functional , i'm gonna give it one .\nC : it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so i'll give it two .\nA : it'll get everything done , it might be little confusing at first , , if that's gonna be later one .\nD : there's some other ones , will address that , .\nA : then i'm gonna give it two .\nD : we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative .\nA : did you give functional ?\nD : she said it was one .\nD : is it technologically innovative ?\nD : not really , not so much , 'cause we we don't have the screen , we don't have fancy chip .\nD : other than what it looks like , if it's really kinetic battery is big one , so .\nA : the kinetic battery .\nB : in the battery , that's it .\nB : how many people would notice that , though ?\nD : but it but we t's there .\nA : but they'll notice it after like year , they'll be like , have never changed the battery .\nD : and if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty .\nD : i'll give it three .\nA : just the material .\nD : 'cause it we could've picked lot of features that would've made it really alright .\nB : would say that it's , like fancy versus creative it's it's different .\nB : but does that equal innovative ?\nB : i'll give it three .\nC : i'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , it's it's just it is just pushbuttons , so i'd give it four .\nA : 'm gonna go with the four as .\nA : really like that kinetic battery though .\nD : next , is it easy to use ?\nD : just so , easy to learn will be separate , so don't overlap them .\nD : it's really easy to use .\nD : i'll give it two .\nB : i'll give it one .\nB : pretty hard to mess up .\nC : i'll say one .\nA : let's say two .\nD : we next wanna see if it has spongy quality and if it's made of latex or rubber it's spongy all the way .\nA : give it one .\nC : wonder if it bounces when you drop it .\nB : that you couldn't it'd be harder to break , harder to lose .\nA : 'cause there would be less impact , .\nD : iain , what do you give it ?\nC : i'd i'd give it one .\nD : alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ?\nD : is it gonna be yellow ?\nB : it it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ?\nA : , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in we would make it little less little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one more conservative one , one that's more fruity .\nB : we might wanna keep it yellow .\nD : but if you had like silvery white .\nA : and can we have like an r_r_ inscribed on the bottom ?\nB : if we had yellow .\nD : alright , so it it's .\nA : fruity , so fruity .\nB : so it was inspired by the potato , so it's pretty fruity .\nA : it's mangoey too .\nB : mango that that that's much more trendy than potato one .\nC : mangoey is better , .\nD : i'm giving it one the mango put me over .\nD : what are what's everyone's numbers ?\nD : alright , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ?\nD : remember earlier we discussed that people don't use lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most .\nD : we really took that into account lot , so i'm gonna give it one .\nD : did you say one , rose ?\nD : also we talked earlier about r_s_i_ and wanting to prevent any like carpal tunnely thing .\nD : do we think that the latex grip appropriately takes that into account ?\nD : i'll give it two , 'cause almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen .\nA : it's gonna be hard .\nA : and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but like how it fits in the hand though so i'd go with two .\nD : worth the risk , .\nB : i'll i'll say two as .\nB : because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it bit at first , but the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be bit confusing , but if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards .\nC : i'll i'll say two .\nD : alright , awesome .\nD : and the ease of learning it .\nD : know you were saying that you're little bit nervous about that , .\nD : it reminds me of the ipod .\nD : got mine , still haven't read the instruction book and i'm doing , so and i'm not good at learning technology .\nD : so i'll give it two .\nB : so i'd i'd give it two .\nC : it it's probably little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take bit of learning at first , but once you've , once you'd learned how to use it , it is lot easier .\nC : so i'd i'd give it four .\nA : i'd give it four too .\nA : it's pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but we we we can say we addressed it with colour , but .\nD : alright , also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that , so , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ?\nD : i'm gonna i'm gonna give it four , 'cause that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out .\nB : i'd say i'd give it three , it depends on how tidy you are normally .\nA : i'd give it four .\nC : i'll give it five 'cause it would be easy to lose something like that , .\nD : alright , we also said simplicity , how how does it address just being simple ?\nB : simple to use or simple in design ?\nD : overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at .\nD : separate from fancy , like that thing .\nD : it like wants to be simple but it's not like simple , so i'm gonna give it two .\nB : i'm give it three .\nC : i'll give it two .\nD : alright , and fashionable ?\nD : it's hot , it's mango , come on .\nA : i'd give it one .\nD : how fashionable can you make remote ?\nD : it's bringing technology and fashion together real really .\nB : don't t's quite as fashionable as my robot remote or alien or whatever he was .\nA : do like the little martian one .\nD : the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing .\nD : and does it meet our like demographic need for international appeal , that whole thing ?\nD : just that it would se serve our audience .\nD : don't see why not .\nA : as long if we offer in in at least three different colour arrangements .\nA : so i'll give it two .\nB : i'll say two .\nD : alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ?\nA : we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to have corporate logo , so let's let's make we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r_r_ on it .\nB : shall we all of them should have an r_r_ .\nA : all of them should have r_r_ , .\nD : and so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine .\nA : now we're gonna look at finances .\nA : have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost , so let me exit out of this first .\nA : let me one more space .\nA : gonna zoom in real quick .\nA : we're using kinetic battery , ?\nB : we're using kinetic , .\nA : and we're having one per one , .\nB : simple , simple rather .\nC : it is pretty curvy .\nA : it's very curvy , so .\nB : never did get picture of those so don't really know .\nB : our case material supplements , we just skipped by them .\nD : don't we need plastic , and provided , .\nB : no , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed .\nB : the supplement is , it was rubber rather than latex .\nD : it was rubber and special colour , ?\nD : do we have more than one special colour ?\nA : we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours .\nB : what the se the basic colour is though .\nC : special colours , isn't it ?\nD : per , but we know that we're having at least three colours , so .\nA : so let's say three .\nB : are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , , we'll like we'll have yellow and black .\nB : is that two special colours ?\nB : or or is white and black , then two more or .\nA : that thi that would be under yours .\nB : it's three , three three .\nA : we'll just say three .\nA : the r_r_ will be in colour as , so .\nA : interface , we're doing push buttons .\nA : and how many buttons do we have ?\nD : we have six .\nC : we've got five .\nD : no , five .\nB : six , with the power .\nB : we'll do we wa are the buttons in special colour , special didn't get information on , does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where i'm getting confused .\nA : buttons , so .\nA : so the case material will just have one colour , , but then the buttons will be in special colours ?\nA : we're saying per unit .\nB : per unit , , .\nA : so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there .\nB : alright , and each button , .\nD : like it like that .\nA : so special form ?\nA : they're all just push button , ?\nB : no , they're fine .\nB : material , we want them rubber as probably , .\nA : do have to do it per button , do ?\nB : no , don't .\nB : they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters .\nD : 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one .\nD : it's it's two to make it rubber .\nA : thirteen point seven .\nA : what can we reduce ?\nB : let's have our buttons all be one colour .\nD : like the buttons .\nA : let's see what that would do .\nA : it's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway .\nA : are we this is double-curved ?\nA : it's single-curved , we have no idea .\nB : we have no idea .\nB : didn't get any pictures .\nD : it's single curved .\nB : it's single curved .\nA : t's not the .\nA : it's the kinetic battery that's expensive , but we have simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's special colour , but that's important .\nB : that is important .\nA : six buttons we have to have six buttons .\nB : how did it get more expensive , what did you just change ?\nB : it was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen .\nA : no , , not .\nA : what just happened .\nA : now it's twelve .\nD : we , they are .\nC : what was our target price again ?\nB : twelve point five .\nA : twelve point five .\nC : twelve point five .\nC : so we're just just about there .\nA : so we're , .\nB : we're all set then .\nA : we're all set .\nA : saved that to our our big shared folder , so .\nA : back to agenda .\nA : are the are the costs under twelve fifty euro ?\nA : let's move on to the project evaluation .\nA : satisfaction with the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found .\nA : so what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to , , use our creativity with the information , how how led it , the how worked together as team , the digital pens , the whiteboard .\nB : felt very creative .\nB : enjoyed making the prototypes .\nC : we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with finished project and we just about got cost .\nB : we could've done even better with little bit more information , like what's single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count things , but given given what we had that we did we did really .\nB : we worked together pretty .\nD : if i'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , we could've taken that into account .\nB : but the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so .\nD : know , really did , the the whole mango idea was .\nD : no , the pen was little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , .\nB : do you think we could .\nD : that was bit of distraction .\nD : that was the last one , like chose not to do powerpoint 'cause didn't made sense to , so liked that had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole thing .\nA : we all made very significant contributions , don't think anybody dominated it , which was really good , like each of us was able to like each of you had your information and tried to facilitate it without like taking over , like our little finished products .\nB : can we market this as the mango remote ?\nB : should we have that somewhere on the packaging ?\nB : have little r_r_ .\nD : i'm trying to think of good pun that could add there .\nA : know , let's think of it like little jingle .\nD : like the r_r_ , that's gonna be etched in .\nB : hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but it's quite useful little gadget .\nB : all to iain for the design of that one .\nA : new ideas found ?\nB : what did we find for new ideas ?\nB : people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .\nA : or or at least be creative enough to think of toggle switches etcetera .\nB : am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them .\nA : i'm so excited .\nD : didn't even know they existed .\nB : that was knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist .\nB : but in other things , it'd be really good .\nA : thi , that's awesome .\nA : are the costs within the budget ?\nA : is the project evaluated ?\nA : now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary .\nA : so , this is the product kids , we've created something really interesting and that we have market for it , especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope .\nA : make in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the the final results and .\nA : do like the martian remote .\nA : if we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .\nD : that would definitely be my second choice .\nA : although the tog toggle i'm afraid would it's .\nC : let's all let's all go for the yellow break the stem off .\nD : would break it .\nD : would break it .\nA : would break it .\nB : it started because wanted to have it as st as stem and then alright , so is it started as pear , but then it started looking more and more like martian when put the take me to your leader .\nD : looks like penguin , like with no eye .\nD : like that it stands up .\nB : should market it to some remote control company now .\nB : so are are poor little thing .\nC : that was bound to happen .\nA : anything else to say ?\nD : nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , its all timed .\nA : anybody have got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take master's class ?\nB : it's really funny that you got spam in your work emails .\nA : but check it out .\nA : so like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere .\nA : but all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management .\nA : just wanna make you do .\nD : no the first one that you sent like didn't realise that it was joke and was like why did she send this to us ?\nD : it's very it's very work relevant , 'cause people send spam lot .\nA : yes definitely i'm very sad that didn't get any links to the corporate website .\nD : here you can you can view .\nB : let's see , what did get through the corporate website ?\nB : it's just inspiration about circuit boards .\nD : you can just see what's up .\nD : it's it's really deep .\nD : takes little while to get excited to load .\nD : that the excel thing is pretty .\nB : that is pretty neat .\nD : here , like , it's like inspiration , i'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that thing , see .\nA : love excel , it's one of my favourite programs .\nD : you didn't miss out that much .\nB : my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards .\nB : learned lot actually .\nB : could probably take apart remote control now if really needed to .\nD : this one was cooler .\nD : got whole table and everything .\nB : now have all about circuits and chips and transponders and wrote it all down , because it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case .\nD : that's like mine it was like , would you prefer an screen or multifunction remote control ?\nD : and then it didn't have like any table , like awesome , i'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result .\nB : it's really interesting though .\nA : it was little tricky having to hand around this thing .\nA : we had lot of the otherwise the technology today was kinda .\nB : that was really neat how got emails and no .\nC : we didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much .\nA : although don't see how we could have very at least for me .\nB : if i'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , would have probably drawn them up , but , we could've put our brainstorming up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense .\nD : 'cause we weren't like voting on anything and usually , like whiteboards are good , like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like brainstorming period .\nD : but we were good orally .\nB : if you had larger group .\nA : and with and with the powerpoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things on powerpoint as that's not as necessary to have .\nD : and these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , on the whiteboards in this room .\nB : because we're all gonna be working in different places .\nB : we if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , .\nA : now when you were creating your prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?\nC : we we worked together , but we were making like we made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , and how we could like improve on the on the design .\nB : so it was bit of both really , we just started out by each taking colour of clay and just fooling around with it and came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really .\nB : it was fun .\nB : so done with the management , felt managed .\nC : we did first of all giving our meetings the time , and second we actually we we did good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .\nA : it's kinda fun .\nC : and happens sometimes is that you tend to have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided .\nB : that happened to me all the time though .\nC : but here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there .\nB : was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , but we were able to do it regardless , so .\nB : i'm not usually very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes .\nA : this is what we'll do .\nA : found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings .\nC : for some of the meetings , .\nB : especially last time , .\nA : the last time we had lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , what , like we we couldn't answer every single question .\nB : and felt the first two meetings , that was coming in with no information , and not made me really like , , throwing together powerpoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite .\nB : had so much information and so much to talk about .\nA : it was interesting what came out like later , like as was doing the when was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me , that more points came out from your presentation even .\nA : i'm little am little disappointed that we didn't do something for losing the remote , because that was big point .\nB : that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like .\nD : the problem was , even when we just were creating from the excel file , there wasn't like option to select to somehow have it included , so there was no we could be like , it has it included .\nD : there was no way for us to have written down that it was really there .\nA : considered the re .\nB : we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task .\nA : t's interesting that they , .\nB : we really got into it , got into it as the day went on and got really like , i'm designing remote control , if that's just me , but .\nA : it was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to we weren't provided with information to discuss that .\nA : know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but but i'm that would require some technology that what it is , but .\nB : there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them .\nB : we were talking about it and like in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one t_v_ and there's only like three chairs .\nD : that's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and always do , anyway .\nD : you'll lose in your pocket , like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things .\nA : it , it depends on how organised you are personally , but .\nB : or like what the setup of the house is too .\nB : but , am notorious for losing my keys , i've just never lost the remote .\nB : put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them .\nB : 'cause was putting groceries away .\nB : you you're taking from bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room .\nA : can't get in .\nB : can't get in , look all around the kitchen .\nB : definitely in the vegetable drawer .\nD : always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using different coat .\nB : but it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much .\nD : can't really take it into the other room .\nB : with our little robot one we could've had him have robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have little voice like , am located g_p_s_ system , internal g_p_s_ .\nD : here you go .\nB : although if it's sitting still for too long .\nA : we should make one that walks by itself .\nB : yes or little or just just wheel , .\nD : that really could get up and walk away .\nA : or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the t_v_ and stick there .\nB : just if you like you'd have remote for your remote , that'll .\nA : but if you could attach them to the t_v_ , then you can .\nB : all kinds of possibilities .\nA : i'm just trying to update my minutes .\nA : decided to how sent you the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them .\nA : just gonna make i'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that .\nA : 'cause that seems little more useful .\nB : 'cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do .\nA : but didn't have like information to sloth through either , so most of it , .\nB : how much of your powerpoint was already done for you , every meeting .\nA : added slides , added couple slides each time , but that was about it .\nB : didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in didn't even think about adding more .\nA : the thing was they would provide an agenda with like several points , but it wouldn't have slide for each point .\nA : and that's the only way remember that need to go other that point .\nA : know personally when do powerpoint , that's what do and so had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and would do your three .\nD : you have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like good .\nA : the slogan on it ?\nB : no , no , definitely not .\nA : no no no .\nB : we no , don't think we need to the and , especially if the yellow and black one .\nD : 'cause was like , it could go around the outside .\nA : we just need the the r_r_ , .\nD : is it yellow and blue ?\nB : or yellow and blue .\nB : lemme go to the web page .\nA : was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or .\nD : it is black , grey .\nD : grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish .\nA : don't really like yellow in general .\nD : now understand the random like newsclippings .\nA : but it wasn't it interesting that it was interesting that our market marketing expert did not agree with the marketing the marketing choices , , like that was bit of conflict .\nB : finish meeting now .\nD : will feel like if you're really doing like really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's an they were so not backed up , it would just be sentence like we did survey , this is what people said .\nA : people are stupid .\nB : it it grey , isn't it ?\nB : yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue .\nD : got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we're good .\nB : don't have the colour clay anyway .\nA : that could always be .\nB : 're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so .\nD : if they ever come out with potato i'm gonna have to .\nB : potato mango shaped remotes .\nA : i'm claiming it intellectual property .\nB : 't believe whole day is gone .\nB : don't feel like it's been that long .\nB : get sucked in .\nB : haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet ."],

fallen off .\nC : it fell that's why .\nD : it's gonna be hard to drink coffee .\nA : so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick .\nA : kinda like this i'm kinda getting into it .\nA : so just to kick off the meeting so we're working now for real reaction , this is so it .\nA : just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting .\nA : we're gonna just do quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another then we're gonna start talk little bit about tool training .\nA : essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard .\nA : we've got general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just bit of discussion close up .\nA : game in real life so want to i'm just gonna you got you can discuss that , i'm thinking about proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell .\nA : so if you say something about marketing , , sorted , is exactly .\nD : you're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there .\nA : obvi if if you if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if i'm like we're gonna sell remote control that's the size of this paper book you say like that doesn't seem like such good idea because of x_ go with it .\nA : we'll discuss it but i'm not gonna ask do that or it seems like exactly so , 'cause we're what we're role playing is you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as .\nD : prove it , .\nA : and that's the same for your when we do introductions and you talk about your background have fun , you went to you're like in maine you went to u_c_s_b_ but you wanna say you went to harvard like that , why not , you can this is we can have little bit of fun with it .\nA : so are you with that does that seem logical ?\nD : works for me .\nA : so that that we're we're making remote control which is thrilling but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model if you had time to check the in real life if you checked the the corporate website .\nA : we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary that nobody really thinks about and try to make it like john lewis or if you go to debenham's .\nA : so we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in user friendly slick sleek way .\nA : way we're gonna go about doing that is at first we're gonna start on the basics .\nA : and that's where i'm gonna need you the user interface designers and the the other designer that 't remember , the the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ the industrial designer on alright , getting into it to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're you are the bottom you're like no you can't do that you can't have x_ and y_ at the same time .\nD : there you go .\nA : and then we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , like you probably got the same emails did but the idea of , yes coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , like that .\nA : and so we'll work up from there and then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as the last stage where you build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ you you can keep on the at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible to try of sync it all up .\nA : so that's the detailed design .\nA : so it's three stage thing .\nA : so for now just for the white board just to get used to it , haven't tried it yet either i'm just gonna start and carry like five remotes around and just write down i'm just gonna write down one of the names of my desert discs if you if you were trapped on desert island and you could only bring five c_d_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could .\nA : we skipped introductions .\nA : i'm excellent project manager .\nA : i'm marty , went to uni at u_c_ santa barbara and i'm here working on p_h_d_ in psychology .\nA : so expert don't play yourself down .\nD : i'm sarah , went to michigan , and i'm here doing cultural studies and i'm the marketing manager .\nD : marketing , expert .\nA : expert where did you go to uni nathan ?\nC : once upon time studied in victoria and am the user interface designer .\nB : i'm nathan , i'm from california , and i'm here doing masters degree in social anthropology .\nA : my little brother goes there .\nA : so desert island discs .\nD : so do we have to for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ?\nA : 'll no no i'm just gonna write couple of down .\nD : i'm waiting to know .\nA : see i'm big music fan if you are , i'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but there's some other options , if you're t_v_ slut like am like smallville terrible television show but happen to love it , it's rubbish but love it .\nD : went to high school with tom willing actually .\nA : the the main the main character ?\nA : is he wanker ?\nD : very much so .\nD : hell of soccer player but total bastard nonetheless .\nA : he looks really tall , like he's gotta be like six six .\nD : he is big guy .\nA : so really like jeff buckley .\nA : you heard of jeff buckley ?\nA : that's 'cause like not very many people have .\nA : and might as throw british person in there you can't go wrong with radiohead .\nA : it's so it really works just like pen only makes noises .\nA : it's kinda weird .\nA : you're like press and it's .\nA : alright so whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want .\nD : i'll go next then .\nC : go for it .\nD : don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here .\nD : this is just pen practice ?\nD : you're much taller than me so i'm gonna write down here .\nD : now i'm listening to lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , chris bathgate , local michigan folk singer , really lame and what else did bring with me ?\nD : probably classical , to geek it out , .\nD : and my family guy d_v_d_s but we don't need to write that one down .\nA : isn't has do you watch the new season ?\nD : are you getting it online , or is it on sky ?\nA : i'm gonna start downloading it .\nC : 'm just gonna put down one one c_d_ .\nC : afro beat orchestra , very .\nA : afro beat orchestra ?\nC : fift they like fifteen members from brooklyn .\nC : and i'm hoping to go to the concert in belgium , in brussels in april first .\nC : it's supposed to be in brussels anyways .\nC : thing love about edinburgh love came from glasgow and i'm happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately .\nD : didn't even read those .\nD : shouldn't admit that .\nA : that's what powerpoint presentation is for .\nA : it's they're designed specifically to ignore .\nD : it's the five by five , 't read that much .\nA : yes yes yes see that .\nD : it's so horrible .\nA : it's so brilliant .\nA : i've seen more urine in this city than ever before , it's so minging .\nB : there's more vomit there .\nD : it really is .\nA : i'm going local .\nD : slide it in there .\nA : have to be here for three years so might as get the terminology .\nD : i've already got more than keep track of .\nD : and i'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like my you're turning into one of those people , no .\nA : have you been home yet ?\nA : they'll be like , say something british , and you're like shut up family .\nD : it should be interesting .\nD : until tell them i'm not coming back .\nD : they're gonna love that one .\nA : you you're gonna stay here ?\nD : or at least get work visa for while and then decide .\nB : that's the music grew up listening to .\nD : now think of so many other ones .\nB : and so there something miss about my hometown .\nD : that's how it works .\nB : burritos that cost less than eight pounds .\nD : any thing that are like free .\nA : two two bucks .\nA : where are you from in california by the way ?\nB : grew up in san diego , but la jolla , p_b_ .\nA : did you really ?\nA : i'm from san diego as .\nB : but really last lived in san francisco , haven't lived in cali haven't lived in southern california since was eighteen .\nA : going to like north carol i'm you you just can't get better burrito than what's available in the in san diego .\nB : 'cause in san diego the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern california they steam them .\nD : it must make all the difference .\nB : it really does .\nA : t's it's there's other things too there's you just can't place it like when went to school in the u_ in santa barbara which is central california the mexican food is , it's just not good like and it's like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive miss good call on that .\nB : where you from in san diego ?\nA : just literally just metropolitan san diego , live like five minutes from the zoo .\nA : so north park actually if you want to get real specific .\nB : my grandparents lived on thirty second .\nB : close do where clare de lune coffee shop is , and cafe forte .\nA : on university , .\nA : it's actually like literally half mile from my house .\nA : small world as we were discussing before .\nA : especially when we're all from the same general region .\nA : so , success on the whiteboard .\nD : there you go .\nA : you can harness the awesome power little bit introductions we talked about some of our c_d_s and things we like about the city , we'll so moving on to not fun project finance .\nA : what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros .\nA : this is what the finance department has told me , the c_f_o_ but , i'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , twenty that's like forty bucks for remote .\nA : it would have to like do my laundry for me .\nA : so what we can work on that later but we're gonna make lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it .\nA : so one of the things was gonna mention to you you the designers is that it we probably need rever it needs to be universal remote control probably .\nA : so something that could do n_t_s_c_ as as pal as as various other formats like if it's gonna control d_v_d_s but i'll leave that to you but that's something that it is gonna be an international sold thing .\nA : but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty .\nA : so we wanna try to make hundred percent profit on it if we can .\nA : so just to close up , i'm not how much time i've used next time project manager , sorted .\nA : is we'll meet in another half an hour or so and i'd like the industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .\nA : u_i_d_ you your assignments are up there and you'll also get assignments from in your email as more spec specifics on what do do .\nA : basic and so need you to tell us what we what the user's gonna want .\nD : what they're looking for .\nA : so actually in way you in our next meeting chat bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , like so is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between so specific instructions will be sent in your email .\nD : and negotiate that .\nA : but that that is more or less good place to start for now and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and .\nA : any questions , before we get started ?\nC : assume that we're building stand alone remote control , we can't build it into other products .\nA : you mean to like .\nC : like mobile phone like that .\nD : don't think there's any rules about it yet .\nB : our personal coach will have something to say about that .\nC : or or can we produ can we sell remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?\nA : have think about it .\nA : i'm i'm certainly op it seems like it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it .\nA : or if we can't have full mobile phone remote that has some other useful function .\nA : no no , good idea , good idea .\nA : we'll see what see what like that .\nB : remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones .\nD : like the little cover thingies .\nA : that's true , we we probably have some time , we should brainstorm bit like what we wanna do , go back to don't really have any .\nA : let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish .\nA : ts ts ts .\nA : not so much .\nA : all we'll find them , we're on our own .\nC : now are we also discussing our initial ideas here ?\nA : let's do it , let's do .\nC : does anybody have any initial ideas ?\nA : i'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause .\nD : start your minutes .\nD : t's given it's gonna be universal , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that was thinking like all the other things you could get remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , i've never been fan of those huge remotes that have like million buttons , you can't tell what they do .\nA : so initial ideas .\nC : but i'm thinking i'm thinking p_d_a_ design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can flip around all sorts of different things .\nB : that'd be different .\nA : that's slick isn't it .\nA : like stylist like just .\nA : so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect .\nA : so we've got this an idea of trade-off between size and functionality .\nA : and we also i'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of so you like like an l_ like touch screen type of remote ?\nD : we want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , that whole .\nB : it's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things .\nA : don't think one exists .\nD : an interesting option .\nA : be good idea .\nB : needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes .\nA : all the other universal remotes .\nA : if there's such thing out there , we could do some do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are multi-format like pal , n_t_s_c_ , region one .\nC : i'm pretty there is .\nC : have friend who has p_d_a_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it so assume that that can be done with around the world .\nA : li i'm liking that idea , this idea of touch screen remote with multi-format features .\nB : making it out of material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .\nD : keeping it and slick , would be important .\nD : and , like , there's such problem with losing them , that adding this whole like p_d_a_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , so we're gonna have to be careful with what like just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this but that would be really .\nC : like the idea of the multi plate .\nD : fi like what are they called , those face plate things ?\nC : in in like .\nD : isn't there name for them ?\nA : think they're just called face plates ?\nB : something , we'll have to come up with name , patent it .\nC : we should we should come up with fuzzy one as .\nC : for those cold winter days .\nB : it wouldn't be such bad idea to have like locator device , simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .\nA : but if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote .\nA : cou could we not do something where like just little lit like literally just very small thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page .\nC : we bundle it as phone then you can always call it .\nC : if you're not doing that then we can have something that just rings from either there used to be those whistling devices but that's little bit annoying .\nA : kinda like how on lot of cordless regular phones , you have page button and it goes , could we do something like that ?\nC : we could design into that .\nA : this material quality as like what we can think about what apple 's been really successful with this surgical white business or this sleek .\nD : and that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .\nA : we do have the minimum am amount we were talking finances , selling forty pound remote would or forty dollar remote , twenty five euro remote would be pretty it's pretty expensive so we might wanna trade off some of the features for lower price .\nA : without without getting into that whole like go down to bargain store remote bargain store universal remote that's black and massive , some balance there in somewhere .\nA : but have think about what we can do , have think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and .\nD : or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , and who we're gonna be able to get it out of .\nC : we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros ?\nA : twenty five euros .\nA : they're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar .\nA : although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the states .\nA : like do you know fry's ?\nA : huge computer electronics store ?\nA : they serve they sa tha they will sell things overseas so you can buy in america and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty pounds about .\nA : so let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents , so if you wa need reminder about what we've talked about the different trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .\nA : and so for that .\nA : let's just head back to work on what we were talking about bef goi getting into .\nD : with half an hour ?"], ["<t> The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television, and that there would not be a teletext component. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer

budget. </t> ", "A : so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control .\nA : and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion .\nA : so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only .\nA : so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote .\nA : it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\nA : so that's red and black .\nA : and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .\nA : and no teletext .\nA : i'm not what teletext is but i'm assuming you do , so we don't wanna include that in this particular design .\nA : for reasons that don't really know .\nA : there's but it's the board so there you go .\nA : so given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our can sacrifice more function for better television remote .\nA : so i'm gonna turn over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make presentation on , .\nB : so do unplug this bit here ?\nD : gotta plug you in .\nA : might have to hit function eight but it looks like it's gonna come up .\nB : that's page one of my presentation .\nD : for your first powerpoint it's lovely .\nB : so the method .\nB : we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project .\nB : remote control works as follows .\nB : this is all pretty basic you .\nB : sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and that actually compose the messages and usually the way remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system .\nB : user interface controls the chip , that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as .\nB : so my findings , did preliminary study here and found that too much metal in remote design could potentially interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .\nB : and too much metal can remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .\nB : too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\nB : therefore suggest primarily plastic construction .\nB : just some ideas that had , , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup .\nB : the user interface , was since we can't use metal was thinking high grade recycled plastic .\nB : the chip , , silicon based chip don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect .\nB : the sender 'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's word made up , don't really it means .\nB : pal and n_t_s_c_ compatible and probably two hundred foot range .\nB : and the receiver is any number of electronic devices .\nB : but in this case it'll only be t_v_s .\nB : personal preferences , really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of certain aesthetic value , 'cause we were thinking .\nA : is is there way that we can use modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics that do have some aesthetic value like if white like if we talk about like like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use pretty , you can do is there some colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?\nD : it needs , .\nB : that shouldn't be problem .\nB : the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .\nB : that's the end of my presentation .\nA : very much nathan .\nA : if next we can have the user interface developer go ahead and make brief presentation that'd be as .\nA : plug yourself in here .\nA : hit function eight real quickly , hold down .\nD : looks like you're in .\nB : is it plugged in ?\nB : there it goes .\nD : there you go .\nA : there you go .\nC : here we have my technical functions design presentation .\nC : so few of the requirements we need here .\nC : we need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal and possibly operate several different types of devices although we now find that that that's no problem .\nA : couldn't get that to use before .\nC : so some of my findings .\nC : wanna send messages to television set .\nC : that would be any number of different things such as switch on the television , switch to the next channel , that thing , we're all quite quite intelligent and know normal remote control does .\nC : now some of the other things found is complicated remote control that we can't quite see my red there very but this remote control has many functions so it can do lot of things but it it is quite complicated and most users will find it find that they won't use most of the functions because they how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it .\nA : look at that .\nC : as you also notice it's quite boring design .\nC : another remote control , slightly different , it's simpler remote control many less buttons but has many fewer functions , much easier for the user to manipulate and use .\nC : it also has bit of cheap look and it's also quite boring .\nC : so my personal preferences .\nC : revolutionise the idea of remote control .\nC : so attain the functionality of complicated device but use simple formatted display for the user to to work with .\nC : and was gonna add another slide here but didn't quite have time there .\nC : just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like having multiple face but it's .\nA : for that ron .\nD : does that mean i'm up ?\nC : plug you in .\nD : that would be perfect .\nD : slide show up and running .\nA : give it little bit .\nD : there we go .\nD : so this is me .\nD : was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had usability test where we were actually sort like watching hundred people use t_v_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general t_v_ remote control practices .\nD : through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic .\nD : and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they what to do with .\nD : and we also found out that fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about remote is how often they lose it .\nD : and then they can't find it in the room .\nD : so what we were talking about with pager , will really come into play with lot of these people .\nD : there's also survey about what they liked about remotes , and they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options .\nD : if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about .\nD : but it really is the primary functions and getting it to look , which are the standards .\nD : so it's good start for us .\nD : need to unplug this ?\nA : so i'll just switch that back here .\nD : need it back .\nA : i'll finish up with just bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .\nD : there you go .\nA : so we've covered most of these important questions through this through you guys's presentations we've got the industrial designer suggests or emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic .\nA : sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is we've got if we're gonna go for sleek look we are putting the fashion in electronics .\nD : we're not catering to the pensioners of the world don't .\nA : so this we should look into this younger demographic .\nA : so we need to wonder about how we make it better and smaller and faster think we're constrained to plastics very , we've got this idea , ron was saying we need to think about revolutionising the way it's looking , which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for telly .\nA : how this voice operation thing is is good idea assuming that it's doable , at least for the basic controls , we can balance it that way , we can see .\nA : you can't say record alias tonight at seven p_m_ but we might be able to say volume up .\nB : it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .\nD : that could work .\nB : with simple command like locate .\nB : and then it could start to beep and therefore be found .\nD : something very basic .\nD : is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ?\nB : that's very doable .\nA : the difficulty wh would be in like you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find .\nA : you have something that picks up voice from far away if it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing that's just little chip or whatever that has the page button , that could be voice activated too .\nB : it's good point .\nC : little sticky pad to stick on top of your television .\nC : and you just say something to into that and it finds your the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of remote control and put the more complicated things into voice control .\nA : or an isolated magnet like , or something that wouldn't interfere that'd be the technical thing but like that , like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .\nC : so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .\nC : and the younger market could use the voi voice control method and the older market might might exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .\nD : making it just an option ?\nB : was thinking go ahead .\nD : are we still thinking about this screen .\nD : the if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we that's an option technically now to that ?\nC : 's definitely an option technically .\nC : i've looked into costs of touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be almost as cheap as button method at this point .\nD : 'cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these four or five basic functions , you can have menu options to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that re is the sleek thing we're going for .\nB : gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro goal for selling these things .\nD : worth looking into .\nB : it seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .\nB : the microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism .\nB : so it's just something to consider .\nA : we'll cross that bridge in la slightly later stages of development but know , that's perfectly viable question .\nA : so i'm seeing that we're gonna just focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but we'll make sleek simple functioned remote control .\nA : this voice recognition thing is we've got market for it don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as , we don't have many .\nA : appear to have lost my microphone .\nA : we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so .\nA : we've we've touched on most of this .\nA : the idea of paging function , touch screen , and face plates .\nA : the thing with see would there not be we'd have to sacrifice the face plates for touch screen ?\nC : i'm not that's sincerely correct , if you take the example of mobile phone that trying to pass portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .\nD : just the casing .\nC : we could have the casing , the the face plates .\nB : back to the the cost the material .\nB : we have to ask whether we're going to include certain number of face plates with the package ?\nB : that's something for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up .\nB : and the other question is , if we do include them are we really in position to evaluate that market ?\nB : we haven't done any tests on face plates and whether see if there if there's even interest out there .\nB : off the top of my head it sounds like gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .\nA : 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have nokia model x_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of remote control .\nD : the publicity of face plate on phone is you have it out and around , it is emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , so unless somebody comes over to watch t_v_ true .\nC : hopefully some people have people coming over to to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room .\nA : alright can we can discuss that one further when we think about whether when we do costs and , .\nA : true , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway we'll cross that bridge later but we will have to evaluate what's most important .\nA : we've had bit of discussion already on this thing , there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?\nC : have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with touch screen interface ?\nA : that would be best .\nA : let's based on what sh on what you have all said to me let's go for plastic built or plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and that's idea .\nA : with touch screen for the basic functions .\nA : and we'll tha let's provisionally let's go for touch screen one with several submenus for possible extra that one put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .\nA : do we have minute it occurs to me that if we have touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .\nA : yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .\nD : 'cause it would have docking base ?\nA : but then again that costs as .\nC : so these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ?\nC : those new ones .\nD : can we afford that ?\nB : can we afford to include one of those ?\nD : and will somebody buy it if we don't ?\nA : don't 't see anybody buying lap remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some new battery technology .\nA : so let's go with touch screen with some with with some cutting edge battery technology t's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing presented plastic simple so .\nD : for twelve euros ?\nA : you can put the we could suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest , people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs go through menu we'll do the aesthetics .\nA : so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on presentation .\nA : it's with this voice recognition option as just as for the simple functions the the on off , channels , volume , and small paging function .\nA : even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging just some simple button that's just another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some paging .\nA : so any comments ?\nA : thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this .\nB : since we're doing touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the the actual interface part of it and things like that ?\nB : or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\nB : what what would be on that touch screen ?\nB : 'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and logo or motto , 't remember exactly what you said .\nD : the the fashion do .\nC : we put fashion into electronics .\nA : it's my understanding that if you were going to do skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\nD : and then you're dealing with ports and cords and .\nA : perhaps good idea but that that one might just be and they just that one might just be out of the range for this particular p_d_a_ would they would makes lot of sense for p_d_a_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but , what do you think ?\nB : 's too much .\nB : think we just need to come up with black and red interface on the touch screen .\nC : i'm i'm in agreement with that , i'm wondering how we're gonna get we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\nD : but if we're gonna use touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like temporary comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is bit much to have it like engraved on the back .\nC : i'm hoping for subliminal half millisecond as it turns on .\nD : you would think .\nA : it seems like it would suffice to have just the r_r_ on there .\nA : jus but not .\nD : if it comes from above .\nB : people aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\nB : they just want it to be on and ready to go .\nA : and that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press button for the remote to turn on .\nA : but then again who wants to turn on remote control .\nC : all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .\nA : if to wake up or go into like dormant mode .\nC : goes into sleep mode .\nA : like that like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen , .\nA : so any last things before we break ?\nA : i'm gonna save copy of this in case you need any reminders .\nA : i'm gonna save copy of this and the minutes that i'll do it in second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\nC : i've put my files in the shared folder as ."], ["<t> The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the

so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do .\nA : think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .\nA : in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .\nA : so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .\nA : fair enough , for the input , 's always good .\nA : so , all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , , and gonna go through you , whoever wants to go first is fine by me and we'll collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions .\nA : and then we'll make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work .\nA : so , perfect .\nA : so , without further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .\nB : i'll go first .\nA : alright nathan , take it away .\nA : it is nathan ?\nA : i'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?\nB : no nathan's fine .\nB : it's either nathan or participant two .\nC : mister participant two that is .\nB : what i'm gonna have to talk to you about today is component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so what i'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that .\nB : components of remote control , .\nB : we've already gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon .\nB : energy source , , our manufacturer offers variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells .\nB : our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere .\nB : and also there's kinetic energy possibility .\nB : it's like the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running .\nB : so that's one possibility but whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate touch screen .\nB : so we'll have to look into that .\nB : the case , we have few options , plastic , rubber or wood .\nB : and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .\nA : what thickness are we looking at ?\nB : imagine that we could specify .\nB : don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres .\nB : the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , and that would cost us more .\nB : and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\nB : and just little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro .\nB : one thing that noticed was that most remotes operate on infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum .\nB : so you notice when you push button on remote you can't see anything coming out of it but there is light coming out of the remote and the television can detect that .\nB : and if you were to record if you were to make video recording you could actually see the light .\nB : one thing that might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just as fun gimmick .\nB : so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\nB : course it'd have to be part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .\nA : is there an option that we can have that off or on so person can select like like the idea , it's good idea .\nB : am that we could do that .\nB : , just as fun gimmick .\nB : just to set us apart little bit .\nB : and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip .\nB : we really don't have any way around the t_a_ one one eight three five .\nB : findings , , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?\nB : 's bit of challenge question .\nD : 'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really feasible option ?\nB : that's my concern too .\nB : if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer .\nB : my personal preference is i'll just throw my cards on the table , we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .\nB : like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and was thinking about was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .\nB : so we're not so confined by one style and say some , say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over then we're in bad situation .\nA : can we do marketing piloting too ?\nA : try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ?\nD : it's an option , but actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now .\nA : very much nathan .\nA : that's perfect , so that makes sense for you to take it from here .\nD : so , 'cause found some interesting things .\nD : you waiting for me ?\nA : fascinating , compelling even .\nD : know , what teaser ain't it .\nD : so current market trends .\nD : was looking at what's going on in the remote control market now and what's going on in other design fields , to see what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening .\nD : remote control now everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface .\nD : the challenge is that current trends now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is very organic fruit and vegetable thing .\nD : now i'm not saying we should have , , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but it is possible to use natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , line thing may be something we can look into .\nD : different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface , having the images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be different shape or , not the example would choose , but what to and the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , not something i've come up with though if we can get around to getting piloting , casing option like not like skin , but like holder almost if you could do like , leather options or wood options .\nC : like it , like it .\nB : should have mentioned this .\nB : as far as the rubber that we can use we can use rubber as part of the case , it has consistency of those stress balls .\nD : might be an interesting way to go .\nA : slick , slick .\nD : so something to sit on for now .\nD : so overall we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new perhaps the double curve thing and this rubber option is our best way to go for now .\nA : interface , the interface graphics for the .\nD : but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really non-issue .\nB : like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .\nB : 'cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .\nA : it's like , it's ubiquitous isn't it ?\nB : taped with duck tape and what have you , you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .\nD : very much so .\nC : we can have duck tape casing .\nD : that goes against the whole fancy something , new line , but worth shot .\nC : it could go with the granola crowd .\nD : it could be , it could be , .\nD : that's what know .\nA : for that sarah .\nC : so interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\nC : so yur user interface , , is aspects of computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive .\nC : commands and mechanisms , that user uses to control the operator operating system .\nC : here's series of different remote controls that are out on the market today .\nC : we're definitely trying to get away from this look .\nC : so the following are bunch of different interface concepts .\nC : voice recognition , we we actually have some new information from our research design team but i'll get to that in moment .\nC : so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , and you record your own verbal labels and connect them to the remote control .\nC : now our design team , research team , has been able to set up system in which you can teach the remote control voice recognition system to respond to with standard responses .\nC : like you could say good morning remote control and it'll say in sexy female voice , good morning joe .\nC : we already have this for coffee maker line on the remote control .\nA : lot of single people on the on the re on the remote control research team at the .\nD : very true , very true .\nC : another concept is what apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with l_c_ display like on the ipod which am most of about .\nC : and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , like modern bit bulky , bit crazy , don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\nC : and some special components , ideas like blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming but again if we go with touch screen don't think that's big issue .\nC : and this is the the big daddy of remote controls here .\nC : the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\nC : again probably not what we're going for so my ideas here and where we're heading is something slightly larger than regular ipod with hard cla plastic casing although some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely very good ideas .\nC : changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and get used to thinking about buying another one which can add value to our bottom line .\nC : touch screen interface , possibly having go-to buttons being stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .\nC : and our voice command system which i've talked little bit about already and the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features that are around so red for power , arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\nC : and perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh my toastie maker that got from my bank has jokes when it's ready .\nC : and that is about it .\nA : wonderful ron , .\nA : lot of good ideas , good facts to have .\nA : that's what they need , it's like little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .\nA : so , good to know all that , , .\nA : now we have to come to some decisions , , figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have chat about it .\nA : based on what nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits , , what do you think about the touch screen at this point ?\nD : it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .\nD : but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be really main cost source then ?\nB : my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote , that's just an estimate though .\nA : to produce each one .\nC : you are always the dampers on these projects .\nD : know and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?\nC : you industrial designers .\nD : do we remember ?\nB : there was some flexibility with that .\nA : there is , it's just , it is question of and how much ca does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\nD : can we justify it ?\nA : from twelve fifty if we wanna get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five .\nA : if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .\nA : so from the board , , that's true , and that's to be fair the the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five euros , so we could probably shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with .\nC : where do you come up with these numbers ?\nB : that's just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails .\nD : though that's what people would pay for , if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something .\nB : it is the new it would be in class of its own .\nA : say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh wh what was your thought on the matter ron ?\nC : i'm thinking that's definitely good idea and also think that we could probably come up with some cheaper means to to go about this production , my my team in the on the third floor suggested that .\nD : see if we can cut some corners .\nD : and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and we can get somewhere else cheaper .\nB : we could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on .\nD : it's starting point anyway , so .\nA : no we could have very simple touch screen , , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever , , we , we can play around with it bit .\nA : alright , let's let's say that so the touch screen will be our our main selling point here .\nC : that we really have two main selling points , that our casing and the voice recognition to be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , we've we've come up with this , with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already .\nA : so the voice rec thing , , if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , we might have to drop the voice rec .\nD : 'cause with voice recognition really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .\nD : we'd have to decide between definitely .\nD : we've already got it .\nC : pass you on that email from my guy in guy down the hall .\nA : what do you think on it nathan ?\nA : about the voice rec ?\nB : if we we do both the production costs are going to go way up but it does put it into it'd become the rolls royce of remote controls .\nB : it would be very .\nC : we we have to reflect back on what our market research did say .\nD : and they said they wanted voice recognition .\nD : course , they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we t'll sell is call don't think give the highs ups .\nD : like really 't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know .\nC : does having both really up our costs ?\nA : 't see how it wouldn't , , there's the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three .\nA : you can't you can't have all three .\nB : 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .\nA : it's just impossible .\nA : we're gonna pick betwe alright so we have to pick between one of the two .\nA : otherwise , , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive .\nA : what which , which do we suspect we should hold we should hold on to ?\nD : we already have research backing voice recognition as fiscally solvent .\nD : but personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell that's what we need to go with and we can table this touch screen for our next model .\nB : would have to side with that , the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but the voice recognition would they're both they're both gonna push the costs up , but , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if what .\nA : what does the cost look like ron ?\nA : is it cheaper to do the v_r_ or to do the touch screen ?\nC : my is , definitely have to agree with that last comment .\nD : and we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we've already got .\nD : in lot other ways too .\nA : so i'm getting alright so more or less you think that of the two of , the voice recognition will be better .\nD : it's our lower risk option which for now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .\nA : we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\nC : it's you and me outside little here .\nD : so and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step ?\nA : 'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but that's our next step , it'll be developing of prototype .\nB : are we going to talk now about the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?\nA : we'll just run through it , , .\nA : you discussed either lithium or solar power .\nA : would the solar power be enough to fuel voice recognition ?\nA : or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel voice recognition remote control ?\nB : the solar power definitely would be but just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install small backup battery .\nB : just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to it's true .\nD : what of people with like the t_v_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having secondary source is probably .\nB : it works about the same as solar powered calculator , and how those those don't really require that much light , , but little more light than calculator , but we're not talking about lot of light .\nB : doesn't have to be out taking sunbath for few hours day or anything .\nA : what do you think ron ?\nC : i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\nC : have to say though that another idea's come up in my head .\nC : if we're really not handling the remote control to extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having hand-held remote control and have round remote control that looks like paperweight like that , sleek little neat thing that sits on your table .\nB : why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\nB : what's the idea ?\nC : you don't need to pick it up it could be selling point .\nD : if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\nB : do you think people that are people that buy remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .\nD : true , and probabl we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as basic manual too , .\nA : have to have buttons on it too as .\nA : but that's done , that's no bother if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever they might have or like who is it , apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the sub-woofers like clear and glass and and then they got these little pyramidal type of speakers .\nA : why not have little rounded thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it .\nA : 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as .\nD : with the bu .\nA : and menu button and , use channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programmes or whatever we can sort that out .\nB : you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of remote .\nB : something that looks on table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time .\nD : way to go .\nC : it's all about following apple's lead on lot of these things .\nD : i'm thinking of the airport portal , like that little pod looking thing ?\nA : although we do wh is i'm recalling that she mentioned that we need to get away from the surgical white brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have very tasteful wood coloured or earth tone still , , , along those lines .\nD : that would be kinda neat .\nA : like that , like that idea lot .\nA : let's see what we can do as far as that goes .\nA : and the the material like the plastics and , we were discussing that being using like rubber softer feel , li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's bit gives just bit .\nA : something where it's more advanced form of plastic that has some tactile response to it .\nB : just the squishy feel .\nD : which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either .\nA : let's see if we can do squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\nA : but to be fair , , , you just you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .\nA : like it , like the idea , that's good .\nA : and we've sorted of discussed costs , .\nA : we'll that's gonna be thing , if we run bit over-budget , that might be , .\nB : about the lack of information on cost , haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and i'm just having to .\nA : we'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of we'll have more of an idea later on .\nA : and we just go from there .\nA : so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , , so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have simple function , , not too complex .\nD : when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on daily basis , although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be take precedence , .\nA : like have menu things .\nB : if , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can just incorporate something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the more complicated things .\nD : and they slide .\nD : and do we wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in true , we're still not making it easier then .\nC : think then we're hitting our cost issue again .\nA : we've also got the the me the thing of , if we're gonna have non-remote-looking remote , how do we .\nA : but no we could do slide or compartment , , like if it say it's lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have compartment in there .\nA : or , series of three or four buttons with menu button and then side an up and down type of thing , like on like on d_v_d_ player .\nA : you see the modern d_v_d_ players'll just have menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just manoeuvre through the menu like that .\nD : it's just scroll .\nB : so are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ?\nA : seems like it seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some rubber for the outside case we might as stick with that .\nC : to certain extent we have to stick with little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .\nD : no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy new for .\nA : we've already covered this as .\nA : that seems to be selling and we we've more or less that we want to kar target this youth market , .\nA : especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such large quantity of the population .\nD : particularly in technological fields , so that's exactly where we're headed .\nA : , more or less covered what we need to cover fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .\nC : what are we actually doing ?\nA : was just gonna step on to wasn't ?\nD : it wasn't in the way but , whatever .\nD : no , don't worry about it .\nA : the , was just gonna assign tasks in the next anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and ?\nB : so have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\nB : or are we just going to go with one ?\nB : ..it's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market little bit , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very .\nB : it's tough situation , but having more cases also costs more so there's an idea .\nA : then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have , , natural wood colour , like stained wood and , , olive green .\nA : that wouldn't be so much of problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing .\nC : copying imac's for ipod mac apple's colour scheme .\nD : get in there .\nA : that's probably good id so let's work on multiple case colours .\nA : but , stick with the same kinda , the same basic non-remote remote design .\nA : alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , .\nA : want the i'd like nathan , i'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , , given these parameters that we're just gonna have this non-remote remote .\nA : what are our broad constraints before we deve design prototype .\nA : and ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this drop down or on the side menu options simple .\nA : somehow work out how we can get this all in the same place .\nA : and if you can check product evaluation with some pilots and .\nA : need you to work together on making prototype , using prototype building materials .\nA : and also specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as .\nA : so that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you feel clear about this ?\nB : that sounds good .\nA : we'll just hit the bricks ."], ["<t> The Project Manager opened the meeting by reviewing the decisions from the previous meeting (to use voice recognition instead

", "D : 'cause moved it .\nD : 's put it over here .\nD : then we don't have to worry about it .\nC : ready for this ?\nA : alright , it is powerpoint time .\nA : i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun .\nA : so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me .\nA : it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\nA : otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , , will open them slowly , no ?\nA : for it , for it .\nD : that's not you .\nA : that's how the .\nA : this is , this is very high-powered here , double-clicking , there we go .\nA : so the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the industrial designer , or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here and what limitations we're operating with excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop remote with voice recognition , i_e_ that had vaguely non-remote like shape because you didn't really need to use it as remote since you could just use your voice .\nA : that would include some mostly just the simple design features for television operation but with slide or fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .\nA : and the the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ were asked to go ahead and start developing prototype for us to look at .\nA : that's sorted , back to the main meet here , , go ahead and take it away .\nB : we have assembled our prototype , .\nB : what's to be said about it ?\nB : we took into account lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , .\nB : some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , .\nB : this is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here , we decided those were the most important buttons .\nB : and then , for the more advanced functions there is slide out panel here and you can see that there are lots of other things going on .\nB : but this actually can slide back in and provides very aesthetic when it's all put away , .\nB : as far as the whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , why not ?\nB : if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off .\nC : no it's important to we talked quite bit about the the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with bit of natural look here we call it fruity if you will .\nC : , that's interchangeable and it would be desirable for the for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something little bit more subdued but this is something that can be done and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there .\nD : it is an option .\nB : that's this here .\nC : so that that will work quite with with regard to finding this contraption .\nC : what other things do we see here , , if you give it touch it does have actually bit of spongy feel , , so that will work with regards to our market .\nC : and let's see , clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .\nC : do you have anything else to add to that ?\nB : worried about the materials , it is the entire thing is covered in rubber coating so it's very durable , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .\nB : and as you can see and if you touch it it does have that squishy feel .\nC : it's actually important to note that the television , if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that it actually is edible inside .\nB : fact , if you noticed , but wrote the the company's name on the telephone screen , that was kinda .\nA : done , edible televisions , it's wave of the future .\nB : this was actually an apple on the inside .\nD : do we need to worry about rot factors ?\nC : it's encased in new type of polymer .\nD : there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , .\nB : we got bit ahead of ourselves , know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but .\nD : no but it's couple years off at least .\nC : it's pos possible new product .\nC : but that's that sums up the main features of our of the remote , if you have any questions or whether that whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature .\nC : did we come in under budget ?\nB : we did , .\nB : this cost to put this into production , we're looking at about what was our goal ?\nB : it was twelve fifty euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .\nB : so was quite pleased with that .\nB : one thing that we didn't do we had choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for classic rubber button and since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite and that's what helped keep the cost down .\nB : so even though it has lot of modern technology , the voice recognition , in lot of ways it's just simple remote and if we shopped around for other manufacturers we might be able to get even cheaper .\nC : did we talk about the voice recognition option ?\nB : and no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ?\nC : so so on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition console and it's nicely designed into the into the overall look .\nC : but the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw come up with .\nC : quite similar to the coffee maker design that we were talking about earlier and , that has given proven ease of use and what not .\nC : and allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user , so .\nA : no , no , that's very , very good work .\nD : do we have other , for lack of better word , skins ?\nD : in play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have go or ?\nB : do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it ?\nD : do we know where we stand on that yet ?\nC : didn't quite have enough material .\nD : wasn't expecting prototype didn't you had any in mind yet .\nC : see , , .\nB : as you can see this is just most superficial layer and it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like it's not it's not quite face plate , it's more like pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put different one on it , it locks into place such that , , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just matter of couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if what .\nD : just veneer really , .\nC : actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put new new new plate on top of that .\nD : and the whole thing .\nC : so there are we definitely priced out spongy even spongier non-natural look materials which worked out fine .\nC : we also continued on with the ideas that following apple's colour schemes with the the light orange and the green .\nD : it's still an option if we need it .\nD : very , job .\nA : like it , brilliant .\nA : what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , got me you've got you provided number that actually sounds quite .\nA : the trouble is was just given this by finance .\nA : it's spreadsheet of the parts and i've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like .\nA : i'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like so we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's solar cell thing ?\nB : we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , .\nA : with back-up battery ?\nA : with the ba .\nA : and clever , clever , done .\nC : the voice recognition area actually doubles as as the solar cell area .\nA : so that would mean we've got bit of it's speaker and sensor at the same time isn't it ?\nB : it's just making use of the same space and the same materials , but , one big curve you could say .\nA : and the case , it's more of single-curved case , would be that be the general and we've got rubber skin material throughout .\nA : push button interface with this other drop-down so we've got two push button interfaces don't we ?\nA : and special it's we've got wood materi rubbery type material that throughout , .\nB : and you have to mark special colour and special form as , don't you ?\nB : 'cause it it is very unconventional , like to think of it as unconventional .\nA : it's it's quite unique .\nA : like it , it's so it looks like bit over budget , .\nD : come in at sixteen ?\nB : doesn't match up does it ?\nA : so what we could do perhaps , simple fix would to switch away from the solar cells or take out the back-up battery .\nB : how do you feel about that ?\nC : that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have battery so i'm not that what the sell is on that .\nB : we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying look my remote isn't working what am gonna do ?\nB : people'd be real upset .\nB : in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have .\nA : what's difficult , we have all these things integral to the to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in way .\nA : if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , it's either or .\nD : although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental the solar cell is big piece of the way we're marketing this as like natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if i've done my math correctly .\nC : you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing that's what sets us apart ?\nD : which , it's that's what setting us into this young market , that's where we started from , so , and perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league .\nC : and the reality is , for me from an ideological stand point , i'd like to stick with the the solar cell , but have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and that that we need to come to compromise here and move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .\nD : unfortunately that's our best option .\nB : we might have to do that .\nB : it's the only way we're gonna get below our goal isn't it ?\nB : of twelve fifty .\nA : 'cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're and we can't get rid of the removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of , , nor would changing the case materials .\nA : so that looks like to be the only thing .\nA : so that would be the it's major change but .\nB : gotta do what you gotta do .\nA : alright , so we're in agreement on that .\nD : unfortunately we are .\nC : no , that was good compromise you brought forward sarah .\nA : moving along swiftly .\nA : so now we just go to the project evaluation which will allow sarah to take over .\nD : that would be me .\nD : can you reach , that would be , .\nA : that'd be brilliant .\nD : didn't even do that one on purpose either , damn .\nD : , was just evaluating from what we know of how our product's working now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important .\nD : so was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as remote ?\nD : is the design what we wanted it to do ?\nD : are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ?\nD : basic questions like , , does it turn on ?\nD : does it respond to voice recognition ?\nD : and overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par .\nD : the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's new interface , that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make lot of sense .\nD : so overall we're headed in the direction .\nC : they like that spongy feel .\nD : it looks like it's going over , so we're we're good .\nC : and the paging function works , that's good to hear , we worked hard on that one .\nD : it's eventually if we do branch out with this product we do have higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good .\nB : am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's .\nD : that's everything from me .\nD : it is set-back , but , do you need the cord back ?\nC : we might have we might have lost that granola market again that we're that's true .\nA : was just go on .\nA : they don't own tellys anyway do they ?\nA : so , , this one's bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , .\nA : got this slide from the coach and i'm not what it's connected to .\nA : so we are going to discuss our project process and that is gonna go into my report .\nA : so this is the point where we go out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and and how worked , , .\nD : as in within the team or ?\nB : so it's just open mic thing or .\nA : it's , so .\nA : hope i'm not screwing up an experiment .\nD : it is now , you're in charge so there you go .\nA : but trust that she would jump in if was so fair enough .\nA : so any thoughts ?\nB : are we considering these points here ?\nD : they're starting blocks .\nA : what do you feel about the process ?\nD : in general , for day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in .\nD : and the technology has definitely been help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new .\nC : we didn't use the whiteboard .\nA : no , no whiteboard .\nD : no , we didn't .\nD : we could now if that'd make up for it but really and feel like if you had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .\nC : and , also had not been intrigued about the pen , don't woulda used it , didn't write barely anything .\nD : was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause liked the pen , .\nA : was pretty tack though .\nD : am disappointed didn't get note back from my personal coach .\nB : as you write your personal coach .\nD : but didn't get response so we'll see .\nB : what if you get response two or three months from now ?\nD : that would be kinda creepy .\nB : that'd be weird .\nA : attempts to contact coach ineffective .\nD : what coaching is that really ?\nD : what if really needed something .\nC : so don't there was lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever what we wanted until the budget came down on us , .\nD : and even then we did get decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be .\nC : with the natural look .\nB : that's very natural .\nA : very natural look .\nD : organic , really .\nA : that's the brilliance of they had they had peeler in here .\nD : and highly resourceful team mates might add which is always plus .\nA : , re it was like really creative actually , .\nC : the teamwork was good as .\nB : and to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste single bit of play-doh , we used every bit .\nD : all four of those little containers .\nB : my one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , we only had four , wasn't enough .\nA : including the the multi-coloured wave pattern .\nD : you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .\nB : could have been amazing .\nA : what did you think about the the the roles ?\nD : they were good .\nB : it's fun , it was it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the time and filled in the gaps enough .\nB : at the same time you had enough room to just make things up , which was fun .\nD : do your own .\nD : though did feel like the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .\nD : it's just me but didn't actually get any information for the last presentation .\nA : that's true , got this spreadsheet .\nD : nothing , didn't even get an email , like that was it .\nD : so , , feel like that was slightly lacking but then , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped .\nC : that was that was an issue kept finding with regard to no but also when was reporting about what each of us was doing was often confused as to what you were doing and then also felt like lot of our discussion would centre around specifically what my task was because that was the interface portion which was what the whole project was about but and then in the end our jobs melded together little bit more , which was fine .\nA : of what to do .\nD : that wasn't very much .\nD : very much so .\nB : that was fun .\nB : the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the powerpoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time .\nD : already having the formatted helped lot .\nD : very much so .\nC : and your leadership was quite good .\nB : it was really good .\nA : she said she actually made comment off boy you're getting into this and really it's true did get felt like got way too into it .\nD : that's good thing though , , give the rest of us some structure to work with so .\nA : felt like slipped into it lot .\nB : it's kinda fun .\nC : an so is that the first time you've taken on that role ?\nA : the first time i've ever done anything like project project management .\nA : usually organise crap , it's one thing to do , set up party with your friends , ?\nA : but you felt that you could keep the , , suspension of disbelief like like the role and the ?\nD : except for couple moments where it just got out of hand and knew we were all lying through our teeth , other than that could only imagine .\nC : had to admit , as soon as we started as soon as we got the play-doh , the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window .\nA : in in legos ?\nA : be fun with legos too , like make remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship legos did you ever used to build spaceships with legos everybody knows best spaceships ever .\nA : you felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?\nA : no , no , , don't was just it's true ?\nD : though we didn't actually other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , but feel like if this was team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .\nC : had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as team .\nA : course i'm i'm conscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you feel like there's team it's like , like , like .\nD : that is mine was the mics .\nA : it's fascinating wasn't it ?\nA : the whole process of .\nB : wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ?\nA : if there was ri .\nD : didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , was afraid was gonna break something actually .\nB : that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .\nC : dunno what woulda shown on that board .\nD : true , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , that would have but know that consciously didn't .\nC : it's just like the paper what really needed the paper for .\nC : because i've got this laptop .\nC : standard , used it 'cause it's literally in front of me .\nA : wanna see the output files from these , from the digital paper .\nD : looks really professional .\nA : wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap .\nA : just to see what it looks like in p_d_f_ format .\nB : usually would do lot more doodling too but didn't because new ideas .\nD : know , felt like needed to be professional so didn't like draw all over my paper and .\nD : not entirely , but still , doodled less than usually do .\nA : i'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like .\nA : like what is the what exactly we're looking for here .\nC : so is this all we need to get through ?\nA : i'm not what the new ideas found is about .\nD : it did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?\nC : is it any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ?\nA : that's the thing got in the email got this powerpoint file but this slide was just there , .\nD : that slide was like that ?\nA : didn't change this one .\nB : we're on the track .\nA : kinda like you can't .\nB : no , none .\nD : they still do their job .\nB : they're fine actually .\nD : am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form don't .\nB : circle would be alright , different .\nA : does kinda make you wonder , , how much can you do with remote control ?\nA : it's like inventing new car .\nD : it's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , ?\nC : what is that ?\nC : our limited ability to think outside the box ?\nA : so this was other costs .\nB : are we back into project mood ?\nA : this is forty ish we should go on bit about the project eval , .\nD : how long was our meeting supposed to be ?\nD : how much time do we have left ?\nA : about you but felt like bit under-stimulated on the whole thing .\nA : like , what like what am really doing , what is .\nD : at the beginning it started out and felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking lot of work and was like had like all this brainstorming was doing and then suddenly was like t's just another two minute presentation that you don't really care about anyway so type away .\nC : it was the real .\nD : what like we all knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore .\nB : definitely when when first filled out the questionnaire was marking it probably higher in terms of how much had to how much stressed over it and then by the time got to the last one was like , , not very much .\nC : was also realisation of you just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which wasn't so clear to me at the beginning .\nD : very much , .\nA : actually didn't do that though , every single one all the presentations either added slides or edited .\nC : added like five slides too , but , mine too .\nD : see only got blank ones .\nB : did you really ?\nB : got blank ones and me too .\nD : my slides were all blank , they'd have title and they were just empty .\nA : did they not have they didn't like mine they didn't come like this ?\nA : like with this was what it looks like .\nD : like with those words already on it ?\nA : this is what that looked like , literally , just like that .\nD : wondered why yours always looked so more complicated .\nD : added slide one time .\nC : added many slides every time .\nD : with the whole new background being innovative , that was class .\nB : that was pretty , it was high moment of the whole experiment .\nA : any other thoughts come to mind ?\nD : wanna know how our product would fare .\nD : 't just leave it there .\nB : it would fail , it'd be huge disaster , especially if it looks like that .\nD : it would take extensive marketing , , an apple with red button on top , even am sceptical .\nD : but the whole .\nB : don't we designed it to look little bit like face .\nB : it's happy face .\nC : actually that looked lot more like tongue from previous to fr some other design modifications .\nC : hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tin foil from random kit-kat bar that happened to be consumed .\nD : an interesting day all in all would say .\nA : , i'd say so .\nB : it's wanna see .\nC : so again reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not .\nA : it seemed like everything flowed pretty logically .\nA : from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , don't really understood like the concept .\nA : the id the notion of it's not like have concept of mug's material , it's just it is what it is .\nD : 'cause it's such functional item .\nA : rather than concepts it should be thought of we sh of of rather than in terms of concepts of it in terms of like proposed idea .\nA : and then the final would be like the actual specified prototype or whatever , .\nA : all in all it's kinda interesting .\nB : so we have more slides or ?\nA : no just this closing one .\nA : no we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could do it we did the project evaluation based on sarah's evaluation of on off switches and .\nD : we got it to be .\nD : like cutting corners .\nD : though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\nD : which i'm not is the same thing , at the time that just made more sense , but could see if they were really asking about us .\nA : 'cause we di we had thu think about it .\nA : and it's all recorded , woo-hoo .\nA : what i'm gonna i'm gonna put i'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so i'll put all that into the final report as , or as much as seems like not like the articles and , like because and if and , but i'll put most of it in the reports .\nB : it'd be so if we get copy of the recording .\nD : make it sound eloquent .\nD : have to done i've i've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing .\nA : there's whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .\nC : what the uhs and the .\nD : there's guy studying it here , , he's studying ums and ahs .\nB : filler words or ?\nA : they're called disfluencies .\nD : that's good word for it .\nA : we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .\nD : just add some prefixes , sounds classier .\nA : exactly will save this into the project documents .\nB : find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email lot , just out of boredom , like come on gimme something .\nD : , pretty compulsively during meetings , like , .\nA : come on give me some information .\nA : to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so do the know , imagine we went the first ten fifteen years of our lives without the internet .\nD : we are addicts .\nB : it is scary .\nC : just around that eight or or nine people that are dude , we've had internet for like eighteen years .\nA : it's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ?\nA : , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .\nA : no we have but not in the sense that it's so un ubiquitous .\nD : but it's not regular my grandparents had it in the eighties and got it in ninety four , but still .\nC : in the eighties ?\nD : my grammy does computer science back in the states and so they had an e_d_u_ and gov network .\nD : there's the fundamental structures , but it wasn't household to household yet because it hadn't been partitioned off and , that was him .\nC : it was to the like seven universities .\nC : you ready to celebrate ?\nA : that's our last step .\nD : does that include like champagne exciting ?\nA : we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\nB : has it been forty minutes or whatever ?\nB : this has been long enough .\nA : where do you find that ?\nD : have no idea .\nB : is that the only song you have ?\nC : there is another one .\nA : is this one of those media player ?\nA : the default track .\nB : have different one .\nA : it was david burns , look into the eyeball .\nA : that's one that seems to be shipping with it shipped with for while , this is the new version .\nD : so is that close ?\nA : we'll call that doner .\nD : that's the end of the meeting .\nD : feel like i'm signing off ."], ["<t> The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave an agenda for the project as a whole. </t>  <t> She then introduced a tool training

project manager .\nA : and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber .\nA : so first let's go through this powerpoint .\nA : wonder what button press ?\nC : just do it on the arrow .\nA : or how about click ?\nA : here is our agenda for this meeting .\nA : we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions .\nA : we're gonna get to know each other little bit better .\nA : tool training , we're going to , , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles .\nA : we're gonna make project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting .\nA : here is our project .\nA : we're gonna make new remote control that's original , trendy and also user-friendly .\nA : and how we are going to do it is each of us is going to we're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate t_v_ , blah blah blah .\nA : and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet .\nA : same thing with conceptual design .\nA : just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet .\nA : that's the the whole process for today .\nA : and then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote .\nA : first we're gonna start off by using our tools .\nA : and the whiteboard thing , do you wanna give that try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here .\nB : we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing .\nD : we could , we could on here .\nA : alright , let's go forward then .\nA : now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal .\nA : even if you are not good drawer like me .\nB : artistic skills , nil .\nB : draw like i'm in grade five .\nA : about one more minute .\nA : and who would like to start us off ?\nD : this is my picture .\nD : drew fish like fish , because , , their whole water-vascular system thing .\nD : it's pretty , and they've got pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's .\nA : only if they're piranhas .\nD : they they're easy , .\nA : who wants to go next ?\nB : it's impossible to tell that's cat , but love cats .\nD : no see it .\nC : no , kne knew .\nA : no , it looks like cat .\nD : it does look like cat .\nB : love cats because they're independent , they they want , they get it , they move on .\nA : love cats , too .\nA : i'm cat person .\nD : i'm allergic to cats .\nB : i'm allergic to cats , too .\nA : if you're around one had roommate who was allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , , it's weird .\nC : in my next life .\nD : , if you're around them for long period of time , , this summer , had to live with cats .\nB : still can't sleep with them in my room .\nD : it was crazy .\nC : they're grumpy and nocturnal and , little bit like the yes .\nB : are you trying to suggest something ?\nC : and then , if wind in the willows badger .\nC : and then if brian .\nC : he's liverpudlian writer .\nC : badgers are in that one too .\nA : and i'm last .\nA : look at my sad sad giraffe .\nD : no , that's good .\nA : no , no , no , it ends up looking like some dinosaur , but whatever .\nA : even much about giraffes , but love the way they look .\nA : they're just such odd creatures , .\nA : like that they're so unique and individual , .\nA : much about their behaviour or anything , though .\nA : only seen couple in zoos .\nD : you don't really have to , , if you like .\nA : but you can appreciate the way they look .\nA : we're getting straight back into business here .\nA : the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five euro , and our profit aim is fifty million euro .\nA : we're going to make this an international product marketed in the states , in europe , in asia .\nA : and our production cost to make that profit is gonna be max of twelve fifty euro per remote .\nA : so we're gonna talk for little while .\nA : here are some topics that we might be able to discuss .\nA : expe our experiences with remote controls , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project .\nA : you wanna start us off ?\nA : anybody have anything to offer ?\nB : we wanna make multifunctional remote , ?\nB : one remote for everything .\nC : and everything being , we have what , sound system , t_v_ , d_v_d_ , v_h_s_ , tivo ?\nB : they'll be phasing v_h_s_ out shortly .\nC : but it's still there , so if po if we're gonna do it or if it's not like sony , if it's like .\nD : it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal .\nA : they're never universal .\nA : esp especially if you buy not big product , d_v_d_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the .\nA : something from sam's club .\nB : so we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .\nD : and what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways .\nA : and another thing that is important is the the design of the product , how it feels in your hand .\nA : if it's just flat and boring those don't nobody wants to buy those any more .\nA : they want the ergonomic ones .\nD : they want like the flashy lights .\nD : like this came from las vegas .\nA : ones that ones that look high-tech , too .\nC : but at the same time are simple .\nA : so that people like my mother can use it .\nB : what about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of hand ?\nA : anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that .\nC : just bad ones .\nB : what kinda battery would we want to use ?\nB : because battery changing is usually .\nA : do some of them use triple a_s though ?\nD : some use triple a_s .\nC : some but , then it's if we need to do triple we can , but most people usually have double a_s around .\nD : so double or triple ?\nA : but that has to do with the size of it too .\nA : as long as we know that issue is here we can triple .\nD : if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with triple .\nB : can you with small lithium battery ?\nA : but it's , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important .\nA : we're closing the meeting .\nA : next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes .\nA : here's what we're going to do .\nA : the i_d_ , which is who ?\nA : you're going to think about the working design .\nA : what do you think that means ?\nA : and u_i_d_ , the technical fun functions design , making it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things .\nA : and the marketing person , that's courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification .\nA : that means specifying what exactly the user is going to be looking for .\nA : and you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just little while .\nA : so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ?\nA : this meeting is officially over ."], ["<t> The User Interface Designer presented the basic functions of the device and discussed

meeting .\nA : and hope you all had good individual working time .\nA : let's get started .\nA : here's the agenda for the meeting .\nA : after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .\nA : and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you .\nA : then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements .\nA : gonna come to decision on the functions of the remote control .\nA : and then we're gonna close up the meeting .\nA : and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes .\nA : first want to discuss the goals of this meeting .\nA : first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control .\nA : and then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for .\nA : and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of i'll just give you minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes .\nA : let's go ahead and , back , previous .\nA : so what wanna do now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did .\nA : who would like to start us off ?\nC : don't mind going first .\nA : do you have powerpoint or no ?\nC : it's in the should be in the project .\nD : do you want us to do our powerpoints now or go .\nC : you could you could do it yourself actually .\nB : did you send it ?\nA : save it in the project documents .\nC : put it in project documents , .\nC : the function of remote control , as what we've been informed , is to send messages to the television set , , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .\nC : some of the considerations is just the what it needs to include it's the numbers , , zero to nine , so you can move to channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , mute function .\nC : and then functions for v_h_s_ , d_v_d_ , , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter .\nC : and enter would be for like , , the menus .\nC : and then other menus for d_v_ as as t_v_ , whether that means like we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .\nC : and we can decide if that's what we want , , if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the t_v_ itself , .\nC : these are two examples .\nC : and you can see on the left , it's got lot more buttons , and if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of one example .\nC : and then on the , it's lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on menu .\nC : so you have functions that are duplicating .\nC : and you have mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button .\nC : so that gives you two different kinds , more complex and more simple version .\nC : and then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ?\nC : and what functions it needs to complete .\nC : what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up in the first place .\nC : so that's it .\nA : very good presentation .\nA : you speak with such authority on the matter .\nA : who would like to follow that one up ?\nA : now , that we've discussed .\nA : do you want me to run it or you wanna .\nD : you should run it .\nA : now we have courtney with the functional requirements .\nD : yes , so we tested hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls .\nD : seventy five percent think they're ugly .\nD : eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us if we make it look fancier , and we just need something that really there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple .\nD : so that's really what we need to do .\nD : and we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking .\nD : so like they like use the buttons lot .\nC : and that meaning what ?\nD : it's from my research .\nA : what do you , i'm .\nD : my team wasn't very clear .\nC : only use ten percent of the buttons .\nA : what do you mean by the current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .\nD : it's like the engineering versus user , whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .\nB : we only use ten per cent of our brains .\nD : it's necessary evil .\nA : ready for the next slide ?\nD : and so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like cellphone , and they we need something simple , because most people , thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but they do need to be able to identify it , and r_s_i_ , i'm not very what that is .\nC : is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements ?\nA : it's very important .\nD : yes , it is important for the remote control world .\nA : could be , .\nB : do we really need to provide more information on what r_s_i_ is ?\nC : like channel , volume , power .\nD : that's what my web site said , .\nA : that's pretty good though .\nD : would assume so .\nD : we're supposed to as remote control experts .\nC : it's like if you're holding it to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , .\nD : but also so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones .\nD : and so personally that we need modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple .\nD : so saying from your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .\nD : where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is .\nD : the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it .\nD : and it needs to be open to wide range of consumers , so even though we need small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for d_v_d_ player , tivo , what what exactly are we using it for , as as the age range .\nD : so we need hip , but not corny marketing scheme for promoting our product .\nD : and also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it .\nA : and so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?\nD : we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme .\nA : that'd be lovely .\nA : didn't they didn't our rival companies manufacture remote that you would press the button on the t_v_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it .\nC : it's kinda like what the remote phone used to do .\nA : , that's true .\nC : like go to the base .\nA : we could definitely include that if we wanted to .\nA : if it's within our price .\nA : are we ready for our last presentation , amber ?\nB : i'm just trying to move it .\nB : it should be there , working design .\nA : there we go .\nB : didn't get chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that was given were frustrating .\nB : so method method of our design , start listing some of the things that we actually need to put into this .\nB : we need power source , we're gonna need smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional .\nB : extra functions will probably need an additional chip .\nB : either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .\nD : what exactly is smart chip ?\nB : usually smart chip is just chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete fair range of functions .\nC : how much extra would the additional chip be ?\nC : is that gonna push us over our production costs ?\nB : wouldn't , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from newer company .\nB : and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .\nB : power source , figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available .\nB : typically remote has either two double a_s or four triple a_s , sometimes three .\nB : it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself .\nB : large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so large on-off button would probably be good .\nB : selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the d_v_d_ player or the t_v_ or the stereo system .\nB : smart chip that perverts that permits , , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it .\nB : this is my fifty second design .\nB : power source over here .\nB : we're gonna have switch between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch .\nB : extra bulb could just be for flashiness , subcomponent which would be like way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device .\nB : the chip and the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .\nD : so what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?\nB : this is just like rough schematic .\nA : so this would be the front ?\nB : so this is the internal workings .\nA : so the red would be the front of the remote though , ?\nC : that's gonna be what's communicating with the t_v_ , but the other bulb , , is good to just to indicate , i'm doing something , it's like reassurance .\nA : the the light up .\nD : like that we know the battery's working .\nB : so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 'cause when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , , when push this button , is it working ?\nA : it'd probably be lighting up the key too , ?\nB : we can skip that whole thing .\nB : so you can put it in the dark .\nD : and that's good .\nD : we should make it glow in the dark .\nA : anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you you said already that we needed large on-off button , you think .\nB : that that's good idea , because that's one of the most important buttons .\nC : just , should it be larger buttons in general , like the examples that had , they were swi quite small .\nC : so should we try and go that has larger buttons ?\nD : like that would be in as in like in for the design , , .\nD : we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , we should do something like bigger and round like bubbles .\nA : let's talk about all of our we'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's wrap up this one , and i'm gonna go back to my powerpoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen bit earlier .\nA : let's go through this .\nA : here we go .\nA : new product requirements .\nA : first it's only going to be t_v_ remote .\nA : we're trying not to over-complicate things .\nA : so no d_v_d_ , no tivo , no stereo .\nA : it's not gonna be multi-functional .\nA : and we need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote .\nA : we're trying to get our name out there in the world .\nA : and what teletext is ?\nA : in states we don't have it , but it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , sports , it's very bland looking , it's just text on the screen , not even , just black with just text .\nD : what is it ?\nC : it's like black , black and white it'll give you the sports .\nD : like running along the bottom ?\nB : you can also get the the t_v_ guide so it's the entire screen is just running information at random .\nD : is it like the weather channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom ?\nC : except the entire screen .\nA : it's the whole screen .\nC : you can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , it's like .\nD : so it's like separate channel from like what you're watching ?\nA : but it's becoming out-dated now , because of the internet .\nA : nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so those are our new product requirements .\nB : so , do we have to include the company colour within that ?\nA : it's part of the logo .\nC : company colour being yellow .\nA : what we're going to do now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting .\nA : so our target group is you mentioned older people ?\nA : would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?\nA : because even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it .\nC : it's gonna make it nicer .\nA : they want something user-friendly , so .\nB : even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and couple extra , 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons .\nA : so we want for our target group would we say , , young and old , all age ranges , all , not kids , ?\nD : no , kids need to know how to use remote , would think .\nB : most of them will intuitively pick it up though .\nD : they gotta change between disney channel , cartoon network .\nA : so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range what about technic technical specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?\nD : we need it all .\nD : would say we should say dumber than the average person .\nC : we should go for the lowest denominator .\nC : high school educated .\nA : so so they need no technical experience to operate .\nB : how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no .\nA : and we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper .\nA : so we said it needs to send messages to the t_v_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple like this .\nA : so if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes .\nC : t's channel , on-off button , volume , mute .\nD : those are the most important ones .\nA : and we wanna keep i'll make note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down .\nA : correct , because people only use ten percent .\nB : do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?\nA : what do you finding device or , ho homing device .\nB : and like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?\nD : need we we need like homing device .\nD : because people really are looking for remote that's more high-tech .\nB : what if we gave it charger ?\nB : and on the charger , just like phone , like you get portable phone and it's got charger , and if you leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds the phone beeps for you .\nC : but you got base .\nD : do you think people'll really go for that though ?\nB : it's useful for the remote phone .\nA : would that add to our costs , wonder ?\nD : would , because you'd have to develop base .\nC : if you have the base , you could start putting in charger and then you have different battery .\nB : rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .\nA : we can make decision about that later .\nA : we'll still put that as point that we need to discuss .\nA : so that would include battery source power source rather .\nA : is it going to have charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ?\nA : and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .\nD : do , there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , if you ge it wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition .\nC : then we could if we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at like another more handicapped disabled demo demographic .\nA : you could we could hook it up .\nD : so older people don't really care .\nD : it's really the people twenty five to thirty five .\nD : feel those are the people that really watch lot of t_v_ though .\nD : they're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and just sitcoms and .\nC : ll , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .\nA : and if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy remote that has .\nA : and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too .\nA : if we said , find remote , locate remote , .\nA : certain phrase then it could beep .\nA : just throwing it out there .\nA : anything else we wanna discuss ?\nC : still fifteen minutes .\nC : do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ?\nC : can we conceive of leaving them out ?\nD : on the remote itself ?\nC : like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero .\nD : we definitely need those .\nA : how how , , how would you leave those out ?\nC : , , if you can like , if there's just way of leaving them out ?\nA : unless you could say the channel .\nB : people would find that too foreign .\nD : you definitely need .\nA : and also remember that in this day in age we need , , like hundred button , too .\nA : used to have remote that did not even go up past like fifty .\nA : so couldn't whenever got cable , had to get new t_v_ .\nB : it's when we get satellite .\nA : get your own remote , or digital cable .\nA : we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making that we can fit all of the that we want to on our budget .\nB : 'cause don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so the double .\nA : and don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .\nC : the colour being yellow ?\nC : and how do we can't make it entirely you have like hang on .\nD : feel like ye feel like yellow one would be too garish .\nA : and the r_r_ .\nA : we could just have the logo in yellow , or yellow light for the keys .\nB : or is the , yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge .\nD : or put like stripes , , yellow lights .\nC : if you have this strip down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the r_r_ .\nA : so we've simplified , we don't need all those play , fast-forward , rewind , or no menu buttons .\nA : so we've pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , the numbers .\nA : can we go back to i'm gonna look really quickly back at those examples and see if there is anything .\nA : which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ?\nD : audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?\nA : that that's fine just for the t_v_ .\nA : how often does the average user need to do that ?\nC : the other option is like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use .\nD : 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that .\nC : and so it's like don't , .\nD : it's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and , and like on television like know living in los angeles it's tons of spanish network television if it has english sub-titles it's definitely helpful .\nA : couldn't we do through one button , something , menu button , that pops up with menu on the t_v_ that says , , audio , video , whatever , language , ?\nD : so we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons .\nC : that could be no you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .\nA : for the menus .\nC : channel is just up and down .\nC : and then add .\nA : something that looks mayb .\nD : such as , , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one .\nC : so we just have it like add menu button then for the various things needed , including voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now included in the menu .\nA : in the middle perhaps .\nD : got an idea for design .\nA : anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ?\nB : had something , but forgot .\nA : get out of here .\nA : let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next .\nA : after this meeting we're gonna be sent questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail .\nA : and then we're gonna have lunch break .\nA : and after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time .\nA : i'm gonna put the minutes put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them .\nA : and i'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as .\nA : here's what we're each going to do .\nA : the i_d_ is going to work on the components concept , u_i_d_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching .\nA : specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nA : and if anybody has anything they would like to add ?\nA : , this meeting is officially over ."], ["<t> The Marketing Expert presented more information on user

and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager .\nA : we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again .\nA : and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up .\nA : and we have forty minutes again .\nA : and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control .\nA : let's go ahead and start off with your presentations .\nA : who would like to go first ?\nB : just trying to move mine now .\nA : courtney would you mind starting us off ?\nD : so trend watching .\nD : since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is important how our product looks .\nD : so we can go ahead and go to the next .\nD : so what they want .\nD : now customers want fancy versus functional .\nD : about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use .\nD : so the customer is confused .\nD : they exactly what they want .\nD : they want us to tell them .\nB : they want everything , but simply .\nD : so we can go to next .\nD : so in milan and paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns .\nD : so if we want to go with that and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year .\nD : really , the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and , you'd want like softer touch .\nB : address some of that issue , , with my presentation .\nD : but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , if we really want to go with that , because it is just trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just few months , because .\nA : people don't buy new remote every so often .\nD : that could just be spring thing now .\nD : so design preferences , we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , 'cause we talked about that being problem .\nD : and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb .\nD : and that could also tie in with the colour scheme .\nD : we need the real reaction logo and colour scheme .\nD : that's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product .\nD : and was thinking about different types of designs and came up with something .\nD : so what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put big on-off button else in the middle , it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape .\nD : 'cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's .\nD : so it's classically retro .\nD : so that's just an idea if you like it .\nA : ready for the next slide ?\nD : and that's it .\nC : see if it's there .\nA : which one is it ?\nC : interface concepts , no ?\nA : interface concepts new .\nC : either refresh it , or it sh , didn't put it there .\nB : mine will always read copy of something or other .\nB : copied mine before sent it over .\nA : there we go .\nC : looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this .\nC : if you wanna start the next slide .\nC : can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the left , if you see on on the sides of of the remote , you have the scroll down , so you have that option there .\nC : and then also there's the idea of the base .\nC : that's like an idea there .\nC : and then on the , we have what's really big trend now , it's the ipod .\nC : it's becoming really and so you have this very very simplistic menu section with the round buttons , and it's like you have the both trendy and hip , but also very sleek and and very simple , but technologically advanced .\nC : so if you wanted to do that if we could find way of like using that idea in remote control then look into it , but anyway , next .\nC : there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as as by by sight .\nC : you'd you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control .\nC : and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's v_ , and so yo you're feeling v_ like volume up .\nC : what it really is is v_ and what it you is is down , because the down arrow .\nC : and so it's like criticism you'd probably turn that the other way up .\nC : but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be , iffy , old-fashioned in way .\nC : either that or just have it by shape , you have specific triangular shape that you're looking at the up and down arrow .\nC : and then the round ones you feel by , , that's the second one down , that thing .\nC : so it's looking into how we wanted to do it by feel .\nC : this is an example of going for certain demographic .\nC : this is particularly geared towards children .\nC : it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like the for the company logo .\nC : and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking .\nC : and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , , the c_ beebies like that , keep them away from other channels .\nC : so that's like another ar , , these are three examples looking at it .\nC : you have the wider section for the main controls there .\nC : you could see how many buttons there are .\nC : and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and simpler design .\nC : on the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like d_v_d_ function which we are not gonna be using .\nC : so again it's like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the r_r_ , real reaction .\nC : and then finally these are like the same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with .\nC : none of them i'm particularly keen on by the way .\nC : but it's like just taking aspects out of that and saying , out of this one we like , the round section of , or we'd like the the button size on this .\nA : or like , , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever .\nD : have four of those remotes .\nA : what's the title ?\nB : it'll be copy of component design .\nB : that looks like it .\nB : so basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button .\nB : so you press the button , it produces signal that's encoded specifically for that button .\nB : transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t_v_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera .\nB : so that being said next slide , .\nB : findings which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery contacts , integrated circuit which consists of diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and capacitator , all those basic things that make circuit function .\nB : fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself .\nB : an l_e_d_ , which is light emitting diode , contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want .\nB : next slide , .\nB : personal preferences , to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse .\nB : if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , l_e_d_ , any additional materials we decide we require at less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it .\nB : next slide , .\nB : just talking to the manufacturing division .\nB : they suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power .\nB : i'm not how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that .\nB : so next slide , .\nB : suggested casing options .\nB : we can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , , very specific to the customer .\nB : options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood .\nB : don't think anyone's gonna go for wood one , because splinters .\nD : that would be amazing , though , .\nD : no , splinters would what is that ?\nB : certain restrictions do apply here though .\nB : latex , you can't do solar power with latex one .\nB : so , if they want some soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option .\nB : double-curved , you can't do titanium .\nB : that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold .\nB : now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium .\nB : and so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .\nB : have one more slide .\nB : no , didn't .\nB : the manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they've just developed sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise .\nB : push button requires simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip .\nB : so depends on what we decide we wanna do .\nB : in addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like double-curved in rubber , , each option should have certain select number produced with all those options .\nB : so we'll have to mix it up , make we produce enough of everyone .\nB : but that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , , double-curved wooden remotes .\nB : and that's all got .\nA : alright , for those informative presentations .\nA : let's go back to now we have to make some decisions .\nA : where were we ?\nC : let me just add one more thing that couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition .\nD : this the thing we were talking about earlier .\nC : except that it's odd , and i'm no not exactly why they are explaining it in the way they are , there's sample sensor and there's sample speaker unit for so , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , jill , but i'm not exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions .\nC : so does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say channel means this .\nD : like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options .\nD : so that way the remote reads it .\nC : so it's got like limited memory and programme it .\nC : so it's iffy , but that's what you'd say .\nD : feel like voice recognition would be , , it would be too hard to really we could do it , but technology .\nA : if it's within our price to get that chip that would , , technology .\nB : we are making the chip .\nB : so , but , , we have to look at what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway .\nD : and it is growing trend , the higher technological , like the , just like the more advanced it is , the better it'll sell .\nB : offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , we'd have to decide on the power options , .\nB : so that we could reduce cost .\nD : 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy .\nA : that brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what energy source we want to have first and foremost .\nA : do we wanna go for batteries or stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ?\nD : the base , .\nA : the base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ?\nB : the that's true .\nC : always feel like first wanna it looks like , before 'cause if it's something really really small , then it's harder to imagine base for it , that was quite substantial size standing up .\nA : and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the t_v_ .\nD : we need to decide , so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want and exactly it could be like this .\nA : it's not gonna be huge universal remote .\nA : what size battery and .\nC : the other thing is like even if it's got few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .\nD : i'd , this one is really comfortable , like like the sides whatever , because but if we have the , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that .\nC : are you gonna lose it easier ?\nD : so we can make it small if we have locating device .\nB : if we do voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at more substantial chip .\nB : so honestly , the customer would be irritated by the fact that it has base if we did do small , compact .\nC : so that's the other thing , it's like are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ?\nD : two double a_s , for this size .\nC : but like , , if we get more complicated then it's gonna be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size .\nA : agree , it's either gonna be bigger with base or smaller with just battery like this guy .\nC : so we sh .\nD : smaller , without .\nA : alright , so what direction do you want to go in ?\nA : you wanna vote ?\nD : if we had locating device with the small one , that seems way more advanced .\nA : i'm i'm leaning in the direction of this bigger and the base .\nC : i'm away from the base .\nB : so the only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash .\nA : that just seems so clunky and .\nD : because if even looking at cellphones now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , .\nC : smaller and smaller , , , .\nB : i've had three watches go that way too .\nC : watches i've but i've never washed cell phone .\nD : phone , whoa , that would , that would hurt .\nA : so what material do we want to be made out of ?\nB : we have lots of options .\nB : don't think wood is viable option .\nC : titanium was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then would probably lean away from that .\nA : what did you , go ahead .\nD : 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce chip , titanium will be more expensive .\nB : however , , we only wanna sell it for twenty five euro ?\nA : what would you recommend ?\nB : 'cause was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce few in titanium , make them rarity so to speak .\nC : that'll , exactly .\nC : the selling point , .\nD : we could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if good plan .\nC : are we restricted by this ?\nA : we should just focus on one design and one concept now.i'm not that we'll have the time and money to produce whole array of remotes .\nC : twenty five euros so you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ?\nA : if this was successful remote , we might then produce higher end version of it , .\nA : so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ?\nB : honestly i'd recommend like since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , i'd recommend soft like latex , because we could produce , how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .\nB : we could do one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , only knows why , we could do cherry cover for this year and then if next year is stripes or solids , they could come back .\nD : or we could like take off this .\nA : they could buy cases , , if they wanted .\nB : and buy the extra case .\nA : it's good to sell basic thing and then sell options .\nB : so we could do like hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start .\nC : the what the top face , ?\nD : because the soft latex definitely is squishy .\nD : squishier than like , , just hard plastic .\nA : and what chip would we need for this guy ?\nB : how complicated are we gonna go with the voice activated , we could give it specific code , , remote missing .\nA : don't think we should do voice , we should just do the recognition for when it's lost , .\nD : 'cause that what it type of , , for voice activation would it be like certain term what we would say like , because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .\nD : see i'm i'm strangely attracted to it , because know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , , it's just so high-tech .\nC : my little sister got for christmas she got one of those key finders that's like key-ring , and you have to whistle in certain frequency for it to work .\nB : see that would just irritate me .\nC : and then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off .\nD : then voice voice activation won't be good .\nC : so it became highly irritating .\nB : so having key-phrase is much better .\nA : but it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , ?\nD : no , we just want it to be finder .\nC : but then it .\nA : just , alright .\nD : but do can your can the department make , brilliant then .\nB : that would be like mid-class .\nB : so we don't actually have to go for , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's brand new chip .\nB : why not introduce it in this way ?\nA : and what size batteries , double , triple ?\nD : triple , it'll be lighter .\nA : could it run off of two they're more expensive though , too .\nD : more more come in package .\nC : that depends on what the energy is needed .\nB : , we could do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause the lithium batteries are doing quite most other electronic products , ?\nB : so they're more widely available now .\nB : and they also have longer battery life than most batteries .\nB : but if you only have to replace it every five years .\nD : that's good point .\nC : as long as we sell it with it .\nB : how about initial , you get one battery when you buy it , 'cause i'm pretty we can get them pretty cheap on bulk .\nD : we could think about it and come back to it next meeting .\nD : we still have one more meeting .\nA : so we've covered that first category , user interface concept , meaning design .\nC : what's it gonna , what's it gonna look like .\nA : ki like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , our logo on it ?\nA : it might be the four way scroll , too .\nD : it could be whatever , as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like picture in the middle .\nC : my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , because and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?\nB : in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , which if we make it curved like hand like hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , that could be particularly useful .\nA : see what you mean .\nD : so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ?\nD : but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have labelled .\nD : like on the side of it .\nB : if it's just up and down volume or channel .\nD : if it's just up and down .\nC : but is that for which ?\nD : you could do some on both sides .\nC : do we have both sides ?\nB : we should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , .\nA : so that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan .\nC : the other option is in instead of scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .\nA : any other ideas ?\nB : we have to make that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have little square , so that the our logo's available .\nA : we should do it on button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , , the on-off button , something , some the menu button , , but if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one .\nC : like having the yellow strip at the bottom with the r_r_ like that .\nC : and that's at the bottom of it .\nA : are they all gonna have our company logo on them ?\nB : don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky .\nB : so putting it on button is probably good idea .\nA : if we want it to be visible and are all those those one that you showed where they were met silver-metallic looking ?\nA : but those are plastic , ?\nA : they're not titanium .\nA : like that look .\nA : but , or if it was really , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , , like really shiny black would be .\nB : for our base one ?\nD : or like gun-metal grey , 'cause then it combines the silver and the black .\nA : what are your thoughts ?\nA : there you go , gun-metal gray .\nC : i'm just really wary of the putting anything on button .\nB : it'll wear off .\nC : what's the button , then what's the button do , and how do that that is what the button does ?\nD : buttons wear off .\nC : just looking at examples , you just don't ever see the logo on button , it's always on the actual casing .\nB : there's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual the only problem is we're using latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so was thinking instead of doing that what we could do is leave space for where the logo should be .\nD : but we want it to be seen .\nA : on the back ?\nC : but you don't but , , you don't see it .\nA : it visible visibility though 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery .\nD : we need it to be seen .\nC : the other option is , if you can see it but it's like if , it's like the second to last slide .\nA : find it again .\nA : and yours was called interface concept ?\nA : for some reason 't get it to just go to that slide directly .\nC : it's the very one .\nC : you see at the bottom , it's difficult to see , but you have like division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top .\nC : it doesn't necessarily replace the entire top .\nC : and so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just clips in .\nC : if you envisioning it ?\nC : and so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes .\nA : like little cut-out .\nC : that's like , , cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened .\nC : and so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the r_r_ ?\nD : some of tho , some of those buttons though are blue-based .\nA : anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ?\nD : lot of those buttons are blue-based .\nD : and then if we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow .\nA : yellow , like that idea .\nD : like if we like the one all the way on the left , you ca you can see it on your computer better .\nD : where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow .\nD : so we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons .\nA : like the yellow illumination idea , very good .\nA : any other ideas or thoughts ?\nA : we all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so .\nC : ha hang on let me catch up .\nC : did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before ?\nA : there will be time for that later .\nA : 're gonna wrap this up .\nA : next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do .\nA : the i_d_ is going to do the look and feel design , the u_i_d_ the user interface design .\nA : you're going to get lot of , , the final say on what buttons get put we'll all talk about it , but , that's what you're gonna do , ?\nA : and you're gonna do some product evaluation .\nA : and now , the i_d_ and u_i_d_ , you two are going to work together on prototype using modelling clay .\nA : and you should all be getting an email pretty soon .\nA : for very productive meeting ."], ["<t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed its gunmetal color, removable casing, buttons, logo,

we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote .\nA : then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started .\nA : no , let's have the prototype presentation .\nC : you or me ?\nB : you read that , since you wrote it .\nC : since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you .\nB : i'll be the vanna .\nC : the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic .\nC : then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red .\nC : because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour .\nC : and then the buttons are actually poking through rather than on top .\nC : and the buttons will be much lighter blue , almost see-through .\nC : it's just very pale blue and light-up yellow .\nC : the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up .\nC : and then at the bottom we have our logo .\nC : bright yellow design with the r_r_ which will actually look like our logo .\nC : and then on the side you have the buttons .\nC : they're one button , but they push up and down .\nC : don't think they're scrolling .\nB : they're just buttons .\nC : and then , the buttons .\nB : on off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype they've ended up with curvature , by concave thing , except for , , can't see underneath .\nB : so i'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very to stock , stick your finger in .\nB : the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side .\nC : and then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do .\nA : and did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be single or double ?\nB : i'd say single .\nA : single sounds good , 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute double .\nB : it's only actually the size of my hand .\nA : you did an awesome job .\nA : it is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed .\nD : good job , you .\nD : those are really good .\nA : alright what's next in our agenda ?\nA : we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with courtney .\nD : it's powerpoint presentation .\nD : don't really know exactly what we should talk about .\nD : it's under evaluation .\nD : so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable , we should write these down so we can reference them .\nC : feel good meaning what ?\nD : like does it feel good , like , physically .\nD : that's just for current trend .\nD : it doesn't really count , you .\nB : it was little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it .\nD : but it's so we do have removable covers , ?\nD : then that's covered .\nD : and so we everybody have that ?\nD : she's got it .\nD : so , we're using the criteria for seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel .\nD : it falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ?\nA : are we going to indi say we individually rate what do you say ?\nC : true or false , easy to use .\nA : easy to use .\nB : i'd say two as .\nA : hello , we're .\nD : that's what say .\nB : at the moment , no .\nD : like no , it's very fashionable .\nA : me too , very chic .\nD : thi would give it one .\nA : one , give it one .\nB : i'll give it two , because at the moment it's not looking that way .\nD : that's that's just like that's clay , it's prototype .\nA : and ma it's prototype , .\nD : what do you think ?\nC : don't t's that fashionable .\nC : i'd give it like three or four .\nA : so , the average is about two .\nC : but then i'm not fashionable , so don't use my opinion .\nA : two or three .\nA : two point five .\nB : neither are all all the customers we have , either .\nD : does it feel good ?\nA : imagine , since we don't have that .\nD : feel like it feels good .\nC : does it feel good ?\nB : the shape of it actually does .\nA : and it's it is very ergonomically designed .\nA : it's gonna be curved .\nC : it's gonna be thicker .\nD : i'll give it two .\nC : i'll give it one .\nD : what do you say ?\nB : i'd say two .\nA : alright , average is two .\nA : is it technologically innovative ?\nA : i'm taking over your job here .\nD : no , it's fine , you're you're project manager .\nD : and it does it have voice the phrase recognition on it ?\nA : we were able to do it with that chip .\nB : we could do it with the chip , yes .\nB : it wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that's because it's only two dimensions , really .\nD : and there's no way you can represent it on here .\nA : and we discussed that being included .\nD : then yes , then would isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ?\nA : don' have the , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight .\nD : and it doesn't cover anything other then t_v_ , so i'd probably give it three .\nD : even though it is for just t_v_ remote it's very advanced .\nD : but it is just t_v_ remote .\nA : i'd go for three or four on that one , so , let's go for three point five .\nB : three and an half .\nA : alright , and the last criteria is it is it , we've covered that with the trendy .\nC : squishy and fruity .\nD : so i'd give it two .\nC : it's just trendy , .\nB : it's capable of being squishy and fruity .\nD : it's very capable of being squishy and fruity .\nA : and it's very important .\nA : there we go .\nD : so our re model slightly resembling giant delicious cookie appears to be winner , and hopefully we'll sell millions .\nD : good job , team .\nB : how did you get that in there ?\nB : the slightly resembling giant delicious cookie .\nD : it it does .\nB : that was good .\nA : alright , let's go back to this no , that's it .\nA : so now we're moving on to finance , .\nA : i'm gonna show you an excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty euro .\nA : if so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board little bit .\nA : so let me bring that up .\nA : here we go .\nA : it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it number of components you plan to use .\nA : do put quantity being one battery , or .\nA : but if it's do you wanna go for this is where we need to make final call on if it's lithium or do we wanna go triple a_s , 'cause triple a_s we're gonna have do more than one battery .\nA : let's just go for lithium .\nA : what do you say ?\nD : let's let's do lithium .\nA : the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically .\nD : we're gon that's gon nologically advanced , .\nA : down to the electronics section .\nA : we're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , so one of those .\nA : it is single-curved , so one of those .\nA : down here , case material .\nD : and special colour .\nC : and special colour .\nA : down here , interface type .\nA : we're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel .\nC : no , we don't have the scroll .\nA : isn't those are just regular buttons .\nD : but it's , but so but will we actually we'll need two , won't we ?\nB : that's the push-button too , there .\nB : integrated scroll-wheel or push-button .\nB : we're really having just push-button interface .\nA : so we can just go .\nD : one for the top and then one for the one for each side .\nB : but it that just covers the type of button we're having .\nB : because we're not doing scroll on the side , it's still push-button .\nC : like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons .\nA : she's what courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ?\nB : but we just have push .\nC : but we don't have any scrolls .\nD : like because there's like one interface here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button .\nD : there's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides .\nD : so is that gonna be an extra one on each side ?\nA : they might put us , let's just .\nC : two interfaces , is that what should we say ?\nB : let's call it .\nA : two or would it be three ?\nD : or three , because of one on each side and one on top .\nD : it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine .\nD : less than twenty nine even .\nA : and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no .\nD : they're special colour .\nD : they're they're special form , 'cause they're indented .\nD : and , they're special material .\nA : we're under cost then .\nA : no , we're under .\nA : twelve point five is our limit .\nA : we've got eleven point two .\nB : so we can go to production .\nA : we can go to what did .\nA : now we're gonna talk about the project process and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result .\nA : did we have lot of room for creativity ?\nA : did we have lot of room for individual leadership , teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas .\nA : now , question is , how do we do this ?\nD : we just discuss it .\nA : who want who would like to go first ?\nB : we think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using t_v_ remote , initially .\nC : we didn't have whiteboard .\nC : and no internet .\nD : no , , that's good point .\nD : 'cause i'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , .\nA : and how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ?\nD : overall we did good job like we got to choose we had control over minus it being just merely t_v_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it .\nA : and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which like we .\nD : and we're fashion forward technology company .\nA : what about the teamwork aspect ?\nA : how did you enjoy making the model , the prototype ?\nA : did you work together in there , and .\nB : no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no .\nD : minus that one fight .\nA : my , and we've all been pretty congenial team here , .\nA : we hadn't had any ma fallings out .\nD : minus you being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ?\nD : that's it's definitely strong one .\nB : the means , the whiteboard didn't work .\nC : and no internet .\nA : have to knock that one down couple notches .\nD : and no internet .\nB : and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet .\nD : and the digital the digital pens were they were pretty .\nC : there's so much available .\nC : like it's information .\nB : really appreciated those , .\nA : they were fine .\nD : they were fun , even though i'm not really what could do with them , but they are awesome .\nB : the use of the laptops for receiving everything .\nB : it was wireless too , so .\nA : laptops are extremely handy , wireless .\nD : and these things whoa .\nA : and that we have shared network where we can put all of the big brother .\nB : and let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear .\nD : and big brother .\nA : have we found any new ideas through this process ?\nD : we are really gonna sell this .\nA : that looks and also has what want it to do technologically .\nA : and that's your brain taking over , wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , .\nA : if we all just went out and bought useful things , don't think that's not what technology .\nC : that's why don't like macs or apples , just 'cause look at it , and t's probably very good computer , but look at it , and i'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same .\nC : they look like they did when was in elementary school , and that's so old-fashioned to me .\nD : 'cause they're pretty and just like .\nB : the toronto district school would only use his macs with their kids .\nC : exactly , so associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad .\nA : just the mac font bothers me even .\nA : but do like ipods , go figure .\nD : no , ipods they want all those words for presentation , even the plugs .\nB : ipods are now quite trendy , and they come in different colours .\nA : how many people went out and bough nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates .\nA : anyway , so that is definitely at work .\nD : mine is amber .\nC : but the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for t_v_ only .\nB : didn't have phone 'til university .\nC : was like who's gonna buy remote just for the t_v_ unless they've lost theirs .\nD : look at it .\nD : that is piece of work .\nA : fashionable chic people will .\nC : no , no .\nD : marketing director says .\nD : fashionable people will buy it .\nC : no , marketing has to actually create the desire for it .\nD : will create desire .\nB : we can create commercial where they think their needs will be met .\nB : this will help them find the one .\nC : ri they'll be sexy with it .\nD : we could have like an adam and eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf .\nA : there you go , marketing .\nC : let you loose .\nB : and so the serpent says , use our remote .\nA : we're gonna wrap this up now .\nA : the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have big giant party , , according to this , so .\nA : alright , team , you did job , it was lovely working with you .\nB : margaritas for everyone .\nB : to the project leader

welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control .\nA : this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company .\nA : and to that end we need all to work together to do that .\nA : and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design .\nA : what's the the project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say .\nA : in in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves do , if if if anybody wants to briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody everybody's experience is do so .\nA : i'd i'd i'd welcome anybody to say something briefly about themselves , we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make .\nA : so we'll start with andrew .\nD : my name's andrew i'm i'm the market research person for this for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control and i'll be presenting information statistics on what people want to want to get from this new design , what people want to like and from fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .\nC : i'm kendra and i'm the us user interface designer and haven't had whole lot of experience in this thing before but i'm so i'll be working on the design .\nA : at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so .\nC : i'm just open to being creative .\nB : i'm katie , i'm the industrial designer and i'll just be presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and .\nA : very very quickly , this don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's think tank .\nA : everybody says what they what they want to say , and we don't want to be constrained by convention or slides on screens or or anything else but briefly this is what we want to do .\nA : the the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think yes that's different , want one , and that goes along with being trendy , the want it scenario .\nA : user-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think yes that's it's obvious how that works , and they also want to look at the price and think that's something that may not need another remote control but it's such one i'm gonna have one .\nA : and last but not least , or first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants .\nA : the the further work to be done is the the functional design , what it what it must actually do , the conceptual design , how we actually present that to the consumer and the the detailed design is how we get that into production .\nA : now the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and let us very quickly do what what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the the the wires , that we don't do that , so everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll we'll do virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal .\nD : it's it's got contrast with black and white and feel they're underdog status and they're , the make mobile phones and t_v_ remotes to make t_v_ remotes .\nA : my my wife says my beard looks like badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it .\nC : probably duck li like the way they look and they're just animals and like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .\nB : 's horses , no particular reason why .\nA : i'm not that i've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , homo sapien because of their their overall ability to ?\nA : yes , tha that's and we need to keep in mind here that the we want to sell this for for twenty five euro , we want to make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million euros so we're we're looking at selling lot of these ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at gross profit of fifty percent .\nA : it needs to cost twelve euros fifty to make .\nA : so we're not only looking at very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at very good price .\nA : , would anybody like like to to start by giving their quick views of of current remote controls .\nC : find lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and it's handiest when you have one that works both the d_v_d_ player or whatever and the t_v_ as .\nC : but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press bunch of different buttons and so it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , .\nA : any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the the the problem ?\nA : or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ?\nA : are there , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ?\nB : it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the t_v_ to actually pick up the signal .\nD : think lot of the time , remotes that come with t_v_ players and t_v_s and d_v_ players , like they aren't like an area that's put lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain .\nD : like it's very very like making stylish remote control would be very like easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .\nA : what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ?\nD : something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control .\nD : so if you want , something that looks like something that makes you think what's this ?\nD : like this pen doesn't really look like pen , but it makes you think .\nD : so , that's bit vague .\nA : no do you think there's risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as remote control and .\nD : suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product .\nA : any other thoughts about the physical appearance of of remote controls ?\nC : something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and they're awkward to hold onto , so something that's more comfortable that fits in person's hand better .\nA : the thing that immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and some quite fancy ones than the some from personal experience which look but aren't particularly comfortable .\nA : any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or yes , the only thing is if if you're watching television in in darkened room you need to be able to fi find the button buttons easily .\nD : from the mouse idea you could , remote is piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see , like mouse button .\nC : but they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be down so you could feel them better .\nA : that's must admit don't 've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's certainly be different .\nA : do we need it to 't think of any re remote controls that know of that actually light up .\nA : do we do we want .\nB : that would be good .\nC : like like mobile phone ?\nD : that would be good .\nA : so , andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to take over the entire the planet with ?\nD : especially if we try to sell , what two million of them .\nD : four million of , but if if we market it as as not as not this you you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks , is fashionable and like you just it's it's like it's one that rather than ra wan want rather than need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having device that they just looks , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time .\nD : it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also device that is practically sound .\nD : so , we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both .\nA : , , an any any facets that we identify we aim need to aim for for all of .\nA : first thoughts on the the industrial design side .\nB : it's it's remote controls are unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't it's you just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as comp like computer can break down and you're kinda like fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually .\nB : they they just need to be very very dependable because people take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable .\nB : don't think we should make it too small 'cause it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller , it's just gonna end up under couch cushion somewhere and .\nB : but so yes dependable , and have good medium range size .\nA : and colours , materials ?\nA : kendra , anyone ?\nC : most most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , so we should go with something different or be able to was just thinking of what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different what are they called ?\nC : like the face-plates that you change so we could have if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have variety so people can get different different things .\nC : have it look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic because that's always the lightest .\nA : that's again don't think that's ever been done before , it's the the thing that would get people thinking yes that's something that haven't got and might need so .\nA : andrew , any thoughts about how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ?\nD : could either market it together by getting control in set colour or with like you buy it with several like you ge you get the the face-plates with it when you buy or as separate thing , but thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , second thing like second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go bit astray since it is the thing where you generally get one and then forget about it .\nD : unless you were trying to .\nB : you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different scenes from different movies and on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money .\nD : it's that's that's good idea .\nA : we've got good idea now .\nA : we meeting is needs to be wrapped up fairly quickly .\nA : so we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the at the design in more detail .\nA : then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas more formalised ."], ["<t> The project manager opens the meeting by going

through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so .\nA : we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour .\nA : and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .\nA : should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms .\nA : and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls .\nA : and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you use it .\nA : and that it shouldn't be too small , that it it gets lost .\nA : now i'll shortly ask for for three three presentations .\nA : before do that , however , will go through some new project requirements that the the management have placed on us and will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting .\nA : the the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and the they don't necessarily agree with with what we we thought .\nA : and and then we'll as result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device actually carrying out , and we have forty minutes to do this in and anyway .\nA : now , the the new requirements are the the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the the rise of the internet .\nA : and and they want it only to cover televisions .\nA : now , what is not quite clear from their directive is whether they mean they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , , videos , d_v_d_s , satellite boxes , which we saw as being fundamental to the to the exercise .\nA : the the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .\nA : and on that basis we we need to bear that in mind , but possibly keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .\nA : the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .\nA : the the logo being at the bottom of the screen there , the the the two r_s in grey against yellow background .\nA : now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the to the market .\nA : but do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that .\nA : it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway .\nA : but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which is is is their choice , but we we need to talk that through .\nA : so after the meeting it'll be summarised and notes sent out and etcetera .\nA : so we'll first of all have individual reports from everybody .\nA : again there is no order of precedence here so i'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ?\nD : can steal the cable ?\nD : got how do start there ?\nA : if you click on the the one that that looks like projection screen , no the one to the of that .\nD : these are functionality requirements from the our our down in the the research lab .\nD : took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see .\nD : everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and .\nD : and general opinions about current current remotes .\nD : see that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly .\nD : so some new style should be incorporated that's less ugly .\nD : along with looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it .\nD : which is plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be more cost effective and we can put the price up .\nD : current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .\nD : empl kinda take that to mean as they they don't they , , they only use they only work for the television or like as in in my flat i've got six remote controls for stereo system , digital box , d_v_d_ player , video player and t_v_ .\nD : if it was my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched to my behaviour .\nD : again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap lot .\nD : took to mean that they just they use it lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume .\nD : and , the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause wh if we got remote that like 'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but and we're going to see on the that some of the functions like audio settings aren't hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user .\nD : so fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , .\nD : and frustrations of like people losing remote control .\nD : some system of you press button on the t_v_ or that's it would have to incorporate , but like some system where you can use something else to find the remote control .\nD : like it'll beep .\nD : and , , the time taken to learn new remote controls is don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for new like first time users and .\nD : and repetitive strain injury , suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , , fewer buttons , like was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable .\nD : don't even have to hold it as such .\nA : gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get r_s_i_ from their television remote , is all say .\nD : it also asked if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would .\nD : and there was another section on our on the report for displays , but the data wasn't there , so .\nD : don't actually the results for that were , so .\nD : may be incrementally emitting , but .\nA : must say that the can't remember what phone service was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked remarkably , so that is thought and it it cuts out was was gonna say , you can't get lot of r_s_i_ , just get jaw ache .\nD : and it would cut out the r_s_i_ as you , , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design .\nD : i've got some other things couldn't fit onto this presentation .\nD : you see this ?\nD : it's it's bit .\nD : i'll read out to you .\nD : functionality , like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used .\nD : so like the power .\nD : using the using the swi the power switch to switch on t_v_ is high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used .\nD : you see what ?\nD : whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most .\nD : so we can even start to cut down on or was possibly even thinking of design that some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use .\nD : like folding ledge .\nD : so that we can go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used .\nD : and keep the volume selection and channel selection very easily .\nC : it could be was just gonna say like the flip phones that they use ?\nC : have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out .\nD : like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath .\nA : should we actually bite the bullet here ?\nA : if people really don't use those buttons to any extent remove them altogether .\nD : just remove them completely ?\nC : that might be the , have big like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the t_v_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it .\nA : we we could actually have we could actually have remote control with wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons if we went for voice recognition , given that the now the the age structure we were looking at we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups .\nA : now do we know whether they forty no for forty five to fifty five age group , to put myself in the middle of it , use remote controls to extent .\nA : yes we that would 've speech recogn .\nD : no this is for pay more for speech recognition .\nA : so , we're looking at again , we the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups .\nA : if we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control would be it .\nB : the only problem think of with that is if you've got lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls .\nB : if you just take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite change .\nA : but if you just lift it up and say , channel one or b_b_c_ it see technical problems with that in terms of the , , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says , , i_t_v_ and you're watching b_b_c_ then then it might change itself , so it probably needs to be possibly actually need button on it just to activate it .\nD : or even you could even just have it left on .\nD : you could just put it down once on top your t_v_ and never have to .\nA : or just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use .\nA : and and then just say , , thought and and then that that would certainly be truly different .\nA : 'cause audio settings , nought point eight percent .\nA : if they weren't there , would people miss them ?\nB : but look at the importance of them .\nB : the volume settings .\nD : relevance of two out of ten , .\nA : vol volume , yes we need to identify things that people actually need and and it's function of frequency and relevance .\nB : they're not used often but they are quite important when they're used .\nA : and would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , the channel and volume and given given that we've been told to ignore teletext .\nA : channel and volume are the only ones that would appear to be essential .\nA : so we if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , incorporates the the logo and and the colours and we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , and , buttons or or buttons as an option .\nD : had thought actually , to interrupt .\nD : you were saying about it could technical problems of like someone on the television saying channel number and it changed we could have like an activation word .\nD : 'cause i've seen i've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , you address the computer , and then give it command .\nA : you cer certainly could .\nA : depe depends whether if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say b_b_c_ one .\nA : you could print actually print it on the device itself .\nD : i'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .\nA : this that's always gonna be problem .\nA : and so suppose one could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one .\nA : anyway , , carry on .\nA : do you want to just carry on with or no no , no was in the middle of in the middle of your report there .\nD : no interrupted you , .\nD : was just kinda wrapping up there .\nD : was thinking , , such things are relevant .\nD : we could make things much more the the eighty percent of people would spend more on remote that looks better , combined with decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much .\nD : alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and it might it might turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away .\nD : but , since if we're marketing more fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality .\nA : we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it 'cause we're certainly could .\nD : we could , .\nD : we , we could even have it as like the buttons control this and the voice functions control the things that you would do all the time , so .\nD : so , if we could power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really and probably it would look better as .\nA : the the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper .\nA : no , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it , , visually very distinctive .\nA : 'cause , it does not have to be oblong box .\nD : lined with numbered buttons and , , that's everything .\nA : who , have you have you finished there andy ?\nA : given that we've already had extensive discussion .\nD : do you want the cable ?\nC : let's see if make this work .\nB : you have to hit like function and something .\nC : is it doing .\nD : give it about twenty seconds , or so .\nA : there we go .\nC : so this is just about the technical functions .\nC : so the method , looked online of other similar products and then just was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have remote control do .\nC : and then there are two different kinds that found .\nC : there's user centred one and an engineering centred one which will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be .\nC : so these are the two different ones .\nC : this one this is the user centred , it has quite few fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use .\nC : so , what remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that .\nC : and so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colours .\nC : and so , for my personal preferences , this one is easier to use and has quite , fewer buttons .\nC : we want something that sends messages easily to the television and was wondering about this example that they have .\nC : it looks narrow at the top , and was thinking if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier .\nC : and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different .\nC : the unique style , have it light up so it's visible in the dark , the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible was when we were talking about havi losing it , to have button on the television that you press and it if it makes noise or lights up like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch like that .\nC : so that's my presentation .\nA : can i'm actually gonna use the it's gonna technical problems over here .\nA : i'm actually gonna use the yes , rather than the the the traditional , won't even go that far .\nC : they probably clip to you .\nB : they might be movable .\nB : they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave on and walk around with .\nA : something like this shape , , something that you can that's more vertical shape , that you you hold in your hand , , 'm trying to think such as something you hold up like that , possibly with couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , , the the infrared or whatever source .\nA : so that , it's flying off in all directions , so that again the need to look at the the the technicalities of actually achieving that in terms of whether the , , the power requirements of the such source , , compromise the our our need for , it it being permanently , available .\nA : whether whether different technology all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for long time .\nA : we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , , short range , not like the old radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours .\nA : but if we're going for if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as say , know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off .\nA : and nothing else .\nA : so that it can al it could almost end up like that , but again , except that the risk of losing it .\nA : anyway so kate , wh what are your your thoughts on this ?\nB : which one does this plug into ?\nC : it's all there .\nB : 't did you could you see it on you screen when it that's not .\nB : alright , , so i'll just do my presentation on the working design .\nB : there we go .\nB : just at the the whole method of how the remote control works .\nB : the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ player or whatever .\nB : and it does this by , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the the television , the d_v_d_ to tell that what to do .\nB : and you need user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface is that's just you kn the sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it .\nB : just general findings .\nB : what we need technically speaking for the remote control is some energy source , some user interface , which we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that .\nB : circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and sender and receiver .\nB : this is just little schematic diagram of what we're looking for .\nB : this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip which then we could have that feed into switch which would send signals to subcomponent and on to light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons .\nB : also send signals to the infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ?\nB : sends signals to the the television .\nB : and then you've got your happy little t_v_ watcher there .\nB : and so my personal preferences think we need sorta big energy source that won't die out , perhaps some rechargeable battery or battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you .\nB : wide range sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed .\nB : also definitely user-friendly interface and we've all mentioned adding locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily .\nB : and that's it .\nA : it seems seems to me there are number of fundamental decisions to make before we your point about the the big energy source is very valid one .\nA : don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of remote controls , particularly independent ones .\nA : given , the number of things you buy these days , which , have lithium whatever battery in , that's , never needs replacing .\nA : perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , , one some typical usage .\nA : the the the battery will last know , five , ten years .\nA : by which time when all's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale .\nA : perhaps we should , know , reduce the , , the moving parts even more by not even having battery compartment and , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give new one .\nB : just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ?\nA : it's , , it's what it saves in cost and there there's , it's actually marketing gimmick .\nA : it's hardly gimmick , it's it's practical .\nA : so think the idea of rechargeable one is unless you're really high tech and it just recharges itself if it's by , , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it .\nD : it could have like know like cordless phone in your house it got like base that sits there all the time .\nA : are are people really gonna use it though ?\nC : people are pro would think that people might forget people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , so .\nA : it's know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now .\nB : 'cause only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies .\nA : when it , wh when it's died is problem .\nB : when it turns itself off , that's when plug it in , .\nA : , , so what so wh what what do we think about the the the permanent battery ?\nB : think that's good idea .\nD : that sounds pretty good , .\nA : is the , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex external simplicity here .\nA : cut cost within the manufacturing and , if we have high tech interior , then then that that sh may be cost effective .\nC : do they make batteries that last that long ?\nA : 't think of anything off the top of my head , but there are certainly things that you buy .\nB : they usually have the little light source , what the heck they're called , the but , the little cells that .\nC : they have that little solar .\nA : som some do , but there are battery ones that are , permanently sealed .\nA : in i'd , , this needs going into the technology bit .\nB : most of them , don't they have combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , so we can do something like that whereas there is battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it .\nA : the the actual time that remote control is actually operating would is is probably , , no more than minutes in its entire life .\nB : it depend if it's depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , .\nC : some people are .\nA : if , but say if if people are getting r_s_i_ from it then then then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market .\nB : then they're clicking lot , .\nD : like like this this market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection hundred and sixty eight times per hour .\nA : must admit hadn't i'd i'd missed that .\nA : that does sound excessive .\nD : but then again , if you of the amount of , amount of use it's like that's it's less than second , .\nA : and and don't don't even know whether the don't even know whether the the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it's just sorta tenth of second , no matter how long you press it for , don't actually know .\nC : though with digital t_v_ , like know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of uh-oh .\nA : so i've got message to say five minutes , how long ago that appeared .\nA : 'cause we're we're getting , so i'd need to sum up very quickly here .\nA : we're looking at extreme simplicity .\nA : we're looking at radically different shape .\nA : possibly no buttons , but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons in into the design , then then that's fine .\nA : in the the the role of the of the the user interface des designer becomes more important here , because , , shape is no longer an serious constraint .\nA : but we clearly only need the main buttons , although , if clearly only need the main functions .\nA : don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition and the the only buttons that we need are channel control , volume control and on off .\nA : it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers .\nA : so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ?\nC : have one question .\nC : so are we doing just the television or are we doing so not d_v_d_ players , we , .\nA : we are doing just the television .\nA : that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , no ?\nD : like in the email of television only .\nD : they're in the constraints email that got .\nD : didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ?\nA : that's one that's one sent you , which which was my interpretation of of the what came down from from head office .\nA : that's that that that that's their their view .\nA : so we can all give some thought to that for for the next meeting , very much ."], ["<t> The project manager

group .\nA : we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control .\nA : i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting .\nA : the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .\nA : they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn .\nA : and people lose them .\nA : and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use .\nA : that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product .\nA : so that when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us .\nA : so again , i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then we'll we'll make final final decision .\nA : and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , whether it is practical to use long lasting one .\nA : and our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for long lasting power supply , then it's sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one .\nA : and it it'll be , , prominently displayed as part of the the advertising literature that it's , , for life , guaranteed for life .\nA : now the the the internal chip and this is where need kate's expert advice and given that this has to to go to market as quickly as possible do we go for custom designed chip ?\nA : or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ?\nA : i'm i'm i'm not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of already on the market that we can modify .\nA : but that that's that's your area of expertise .\nA : and then the , , the the overall design of the case is is is kendra's field and we we had some discussions last time as as to how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those da today .\nA : and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we go for voice , buttons , or or bit of both .\nA : and then , , for the next meeting kate will be looking at the the the the look , feel and design , kendra the ho how the the user actually uses it and and andrew the the product evaluation .\nA : and kate and kendra will be producing model for us to to look at .\nA : so , if if we can have the the three presentations again , and perhaps you'd like to start .\nB : there we go .\nB : i'll just be talking about the components design .\nB : and , looked at what exactly do remotes do .\nB : they for you to press key or give voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the t_v_ .\nB : the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with diode transistor or resonator , two more resistors and capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with resistor and capacitor .\nB : what happens is you'll press number or give voice command and this creates connection within the the remote thows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces signal in morse code format .\nB : this signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and which is then trai changed into infrared light which is sent to the t_v_ and seen by the t_v_ and which changes the channels .\nB : so as for how we should end up using this in our remote couple of main questions are the buttons .\nB : the fewer buttons you have , the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need .\nB : however to not have buttons or to use voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and raise the production cost .\nB : that's something we should think about .\nB : also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost-effective way of producing it .\nB : also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so was thinking perhaps combination of solar cells with back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .\nB : we also need to look at the chips , custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have upon .\nB : however that's gonna cost more , but the off the shelf is gonna be cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to to convert , so if we were definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip .\nB : and that sums it up .\nA : so how , can you just put that one back up again , ?\nA : inevitably custom design chip is gonna be more expensive .\nA : do we do we know by how much ?\nB : don't actually have any price information , no .\nA : and and do we know how long it'll take to develop custom chip .\nB : it lot longer than an off the shelf chip .\nB : we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , it's still still in an ex experimental form , so it would it's hard to predict the time .\nA : we need to make decision here .\nA : given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .\nA : now before we go round everybody else , does anybody have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ?\nC : have question about that .\nC : does it make difference if there are just few commands , if you can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say b_b_c_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have certain number of favourites and that .\nB : just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick .\nB : once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's the the world the the sky is your limit , but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working .\nC : then it doesn't matter .\nA : must say find it slightly surprising given that , , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling .\nA : so for slightly different no , , it's if you you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so bu the this this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ?\nB : bits of it , .\nA : so , true , again but if it's without any without any price informations that's difficult to decide .\nC : mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , , hundred and fifty pounds .\nB : yes , as .\nC : as opposed to the twenty euros , twenty five euros .\nD : also lots of mobile phones have got lot of technology in them , not just that , so .\nA : it's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is .\nA : su if given that the the technology is not developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , the double risk , perhaps we ought to stick to to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present product that doesn't work .\nC : another thought , , go ahead .\nD : would was just gonna say mayb it sh like we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .\nA : do do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ?\nB : it's fundament it it's something we've discussed since the the the beginning , so in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but that the the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so you have to .\nC : kinda we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then we should have it for the whole thing .\nC : and we've been talking about it the whole time .\nC : anyway , i'm i'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .\nD : it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative .\nD : from my presentation show , so .\nA : it should be , , so .\nB : no , that sounds good .\nA : it will have voice recognition if if that means if that means we can't afford buttons but second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as backup or just so that people can just sit there pressing buttons ?\nB : would say we do , .\nA : did you want to say anything ?\nB : nope , that was it , that was it .\nA : shall we move rapidly on to kendra ?\nA : ra rapidly move the cable over .\nC : is it gonna work ?\nB : it's thinking about it .\nA : it'll get there .\nC : so did some research on the internet and what , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just variety of choices .\nC : findings , so lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just couple examples of different kinds that are little bit more unusual .\nC : there're some special ones available , like this one here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that we need to watch out for is v_ in volume because people some bring little picture of what ours could look like .\nC : so just minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is slide button , like you have on mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .\nA : if interrupt you .\nA : do you wanna say anything about slide controls ?\nA : the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable .\nB : they're they're about the same cost really .\nB : it's just the the there's lot of slide buttons out there .\nB : it's the same connection .\nA : fair enough , fine .\nC : just because if i'm using mouse like to be able to slide it up and down so it might be good for volume to just be able to roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my little drawing .\nA : good , good .\nA : so three three there's three buttons on slider .\nA : three buttons , channel up channel up down and .\nC : yes , yes .\nD : if you if you if you got channel up down , we can have slider in that as .\nD : because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it like has got if you it like sticks , if what , up like one unit , if you see what .\nD : so it kinda goes up one , then like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like cog .\nD : so you kinda take it up one at time .\nC : the only advantage was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to know , , this is just the volume and this is the channel .\nA : this one on the one side and one .\nD : you could you could as as like mouse you could , like the shape of it almost like mouse , with dep if it depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , , it looks like you can control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers .\nB : ye , 'cause i've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different .\nB : you'd you were fiddling with .\nA : or the thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know it's going to do .\nA : so we we're looking at sliders for both volume and channel change of one sort .\nC : was thinking just for the volume , but what what do you think ?\nA : just for the volume , .\nC : we could , .\nB : 'cause if , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would , , .\nA : it's it's it , it it it seems to me that it it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , that there's no no possibility of confusing the two .\nC : i'm just gonna pass this along .\nA : so that's is that you want to say at the mo , fine .\nD : here we go .\nD : this is my report on trend watching .\nD : the data's come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer .\nD : and we got reports from paris , milan on new fashions .\nD : and the most important aspect is the the look it has to look fancy , look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel .\nD : this is st was gonna say twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative side of it .\nD : so and the third being easy to use is probably given , we have to try and incorporate , so exactly , .\nA : that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .\nD : that out of sequence ?\nD : and from the fashion watchers from milan and paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera .\nD : clothes , shoes and furniture and spongy material to be used on the on the outside .\nA : hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly .\nD : but was gonna say , fruit and vegetables , important to this year important to furniture , i'm just gonna say like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is the line we gotta be going through .\nD : but fashions do don't last very long .\nB : that can kinda tie into our changing face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , .\nD : we can have sp like spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and .\nC : like the kind you get on like hand weights .\nB : , that weird what that is , but .\nA : also means you can drop it without damaging it .\nB : , it's good as .\nD : you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , , could we have cheaper cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ?\nD : instead of having ten year guarantee ?\nD : with interchangeable covers , could just buy new one every year , new one when new fashions come out .\nA : it its that's an interesting idea , it's like the old swatch watch where on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as fashion item before .\nA : that's yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity we we can but my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , , long time .\nC : wh what if we included the batteries in the cover ?\nB : it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in whole new product .\nA : but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy new one every year then it it's it's even better .\nC : so like , so can see that thing ?\nB : also encourages to buy new covers and .\nA : , know the only the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it you've then got the connection and you've immediately got unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , , completely soldered together and it it it , total reliability , but you're saying and understand where you're coming from .\nC : just this as examples .\nC : so , that's true .\nD : or , but like like more than just the battery , like complete different like you've only got like , like this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone .\nD : and then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees .\nD : and then , you probably are .\nA : if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about even if it costs slightly more than that , just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs and , giving people the option of buying new complete new thing , the advantage of replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have cover on , it will still work .\nA : then if , , if people lose the cover , they they might be nclined to go out and spend however many euros on on new one rather than complete new re remote .\nB : that that's just it with the covers , you're tricking into continuing to spend their money on our products without making feel like they're being ripped off having to buy new product .\nA : it is it's up to it's up to , it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into fashion item .\nC : just another five euro to get .\nA : and , , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , , readily available .\nA : and that's , , .\nB : and that's the thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly .\nC : like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours .\nB : , exactly , exactly .\nA : we hadn't finished your it's the thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their coffee table to say this says something about me .\nD : don't worry it's all said , was just gonna say , are we gonna make this as part of like like part of the like it it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ?\nA : this is fashionable .\nD : this is fashionable with .\nA : , i'm i'm i'm with it , i'm up to date .\nA : and , the the design that i've got , and and it could be home-made design , this says this is not just television remote control , this is , , fashion accessory .\nA : so the the the basic shape is is what we given that we've got one one on off button presumably , two buttons for channel change and one slider and nothing else , we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing .\nA : and , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and don't suggest we make it look like banana , but know the the organic , , curved look , , to deliberately get away from the , the the the the square look of most current remotes and , , whether whether the , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow .\nA : or 'cause there's certainly , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed so that people looked at it and say , that's real reaction remote control , want one of those .\nB : that we should make the whole thing yellow kinda thought with you'd have like yellow circle with the r_r_ in it somewhere on it , but i'd yellow seems bit of strong colour to make the ent like the thing no , but just like white or grey or black or some blah colour .\nA : the the or or , i'd i'd .\nA : no agree , we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently .\nD : and make that fashion symbol as .\nC : was kinda picturing like shape that's almost like mouse .\nA : this is this is the whole point , yes , , i'm i've got real reaction remote control to go with my real reaction coffee maker or or whatever .\nA : and then people , , people demand more real reaction .\nC : so that , , when they hold it it's because mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand we could make it slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power , wherever , somewhere .\nC : that was just an idea that had .\nA : no that there's the sim my my idea was something probably bit fatter than this but tha that sorta shape so that you can just ho hold it .\nB : you'd want it narrower than mouse though 'cause it mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip .\nA : it t's it's it's mouse , but held , , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , with , , and fiddling with the buttons .\nB : so it'd be , .\nB : and fiddle around with it and press it .\nC : so , little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had , then wider up here .\nB : almost like hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an .\nC : and then it would have wider thing to have the light , the infrared light at the t_v_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up up the top .\nC : what do you think about that ?\nD : that sounds i'm just i'm suddenly realising that we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels we still can just tell it to .\nD : are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ?\nA : it's very good point .\nC : it is very good point .\nA : we we decided that we're actually going down both routes .\nA : that the we we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that .\nB : but do , this shape also les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque , , .\nA : then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , , .\nC : and just say , suppose sup so we could have menu button as .\nD : we cou like like we're leaving out the buttons for the the less frequently used , but we could incorporate that into the voice .\nA : honest my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway .\nD : suppose , but there is the off chance that , , the brightness is wrong on your t_v_ or the contrast needs changing .\nA : it's cer it's certainly possible , but they we we're going beyond given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work .\nB : you can still incorporate the voice with with less buttons .\nB : if the power button was also somehow like menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , , brightness and tint and .\nD : that's good idea .\nA : if we we're i'm getting clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .\nC : we could have the channels and the power and then menu button and then the volume .\nC : so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .\nA : if we if we're going down that route , then we need some display .\nA : do we need some display ?\nB : but the television would be the display that things like that usually pop up on televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it .\nC : that's on the t_v_ , .\nA : we actually use the television , .\nC : and then , press that is , that might work .\nD : on onto like mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually button as , you could press it , you could press that and have it as menu button .\nB : , that's true .\nB : never understood how that worked though , but .\nC : it's like , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it .\nC : you just press it .\nC : and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .\nA : we got five minutes to go in this meeting , so we've actually very conveniently just come to good point to to sum up .\nA : so kate and kendra now go away and pa play play with bit of plasticine or play-dough , whatever it is on the other side of the atlantic .\nB : play with play-dough .\nA : and actually put what we've discussed into something was gonna say concrete , but that's slightly inappropriate word to something that we can we can see and andrew can go away and think about how we can actually market this as concept and not not just simple remote control .\nD : can get some things clear just for my sake .\nD : our energy source is gonna be long term .\nA : we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of , , manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for long term battery source , , on the basis that that , , if we're going for making it fashion statement , then people are more likely to change it anyway before it runs out and make an assumption that we we can aim for battery that will last most people for we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll we will guarantee it for for five years .\nD : and we're having custom chip ?\nA : we're having custom chip , but given the the we've cut the functions down , that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that technol technological innovation is important , then we need to , i'll say it again , technologically innovate .\nA : and we we , know , we must resist any efforts to to try and water that down .\nD : and interchangeable case ?\nA : interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept .\nA : it it should be cheap , , if if we avoid any , , electrical connections .\nA : and , if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want , then this is new .\nA : we we whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got good selection of covers that they can use anyway , and and if if we can keep them , , rolling , then , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to any of the famous supermarkets , won't mention any mention any names , it's it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better .\nD : and are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or .\nA : the that that's no , because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant .\nB : does actually , , .\nC : and especially for making them so like different and .\nB : different to feel , , .\nA : and the , that that solves one of the problems of of battery life , 'cause that would that would clobber the battery life , so no , given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually unnecessary .\nD : are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just as wide as possible .\nA : as as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , , anyway like you're likely to and it's , it will work most of the time .\nC : like this or like this .\nA : not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the the television doesn't work .\nA : sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then the the whole of the top would be the the infrared .\nC : kinda like this whole so you could use like this and it would go .\nA : so , 'cause the reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , then then that that's the coverage that we want .\nA : we're all clear where we go from here .\nA : so very much and i'll see you all again in thirty minutes ."], ["<t> The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. </t>  <t> Then the industrial designer and interface specialist present the

done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details .\nA : the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close .\nA : so if if you'd like to present your your proposals .\nB : we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , .\nB : on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push .\nB : this is the power key , it's kinda like the biggest so how to turn on .\nB : that's the little menu key .\nB : this is the infra-red section so you it'll be sending rays and if you're pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it .\nA : , good , good .\nB : we got microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can talk to it like that and it'll still understand .\nB : the logo is down down there and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through .\nC : and so we figured it would be light weight plastic , just light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that rubbery material like they make ipod covers , so they kinda just stretch over .\nA : showing me age , what ipod covers are like .\nC : didn't know that but they're it's just rubbery and that way spongy like is something that people wanted and it just stretches over and that way probably helps protect it little bit too as and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r_r_ .\nB : but it's also easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you .\nB : this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine .\nB : li that'll be the covers as , .\nA : tha it's it's detailed point , wondered how will people put these down wonder ?\nA : for some strange re reason had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but , no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as as fashion item it it's it it's just it's just minor detailed point , but as you say you can just make the base little bit bigger and and it just needs another another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them because actually have several upon the , .\nB : it could stand , .\nB : could broaden the broaden it out bit so it would stand like that .\nB : we could just widen it out .\nD : could have one for your stereo , one for your d_v_ player .\nB : have to if we just lengthen it so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there .\nC : just or just make it little .\nA : but that that's but no the the the overall the overall concept is , no no , that's these .\nC : somewhere like that so it just .\nB : we might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , , , like that , like that .\nD : kinda had kinda natural idea where it's like more of like kinda slightly like thinner , , kinda like that kinda like flower or plant for the more natural kinda , just click there .\nA : but but no but the the the the , , , it it's wouldn't wouldn't do that , .\nB : the final product would actually stand up , .\nA : but but the these were all minor minor minor details , the the basic concept is is bang on and the it certainly meets our criteria of being of looking different .\nC : 's little longer .\nA : so good that's that that's excellent .\nA : let us what's on the next one ?\nA : yes , let's have look at the finance .\nA : now we're given clear design brief , if get the spreadsheet up .\nD : the the maximise button .\nA : good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the the the the boss can understand .\nA : now i've this is the company's costing for for various aspects of design and i've treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us , wouldn't know for in if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not special colour , that's that's standard colour .\nA : so we're just simply on batteries , the the one the one decision i've had to make is that we're we will have to find regular standard chip to to do this with and i'm i'm i'm certain that they they are around so , that don't serious problem .\nA : the the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made basic decision that that was fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay .\nA : then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to to make 'cause of the the the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept we we should exceed the the sales targets .\nA : it's simply made of plastic so that's that's no problem and just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's there's some cost there .\nA : and we haven't actually got scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and simple slider so and the and the the buttons are do that they're special colour .\nA : anyway the the costings come in at exactly on target at twelve point five but thi we have very strong case to argue that what what we've got is is so in innovative and and different that any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the the the the the the concept of it being fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative that they they have to accept that we we can't operate within the constraints that they give , so we we we present this as the the company's the the company's way forward and we can argue that we we have come in on on budget .\nA : does anybody want to andrew do you want what do you want to say about the the evaluation where where where where we're where where we're at ?\nD : the the product or the project ?\nA : the the the the the product .\nD : ll my presentation just now ?\nD : can get the cheers .\nA : more loud clicks in the microphone .\nD : there we go , .\nD : method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management .\nD : so what i've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard gauge our team response to these questions .\nD : so , on scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false .\nA : seven being round number to work to .\nD : and then at the end just take an average yes .\nA : tr on for true and seven for flase .\nD : so , look at these questions .\nD : is the device flashy and fashionable ?\nB : i'd say definitely one .\nD : so and also technologically innovative ?\nA : yes the voice technology .\nD : easy to use ?\nA : don't see we could've made it any easier .\nD : suitable for the consumer ?\nC : it made we met all of the consumer wants .\nD : is it complicated ?\nD : doing pretty so far aren't we ?\nD : where are we ?\nD : we've built in the the speech , where are you , function .\nA : does it take long to learn to use ?\nB : no , not .\nD : and , what else ?\nD : the r_s_i_ compares to the current standards , .\nA : less buttons so it must be .\nB : it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as .\nD : we we it was our it was we made an actual effort to will device appeal to all age groups ?\nA : it will because old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so and it's it's it's don't think we're actually charging particular premium anyway , in the end , so .\nD : that's good call , .\nD : had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the ease of use of the device might make up for that .\nB : it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but it should still appeal on certain level to everybody , .\nA : it will appeal for dif for different reasons but it's it's so , so we can reasonably say it's another another one , why not ?\nC : just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having million buttons .\nD : can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ?\nD : and what did we make the management's .\nA : in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions is that yes it it meets the requirement is it's television only , it's it's simple to use , it's it's it's within budget , it's yes an an any minor points we we we argue .\nC : under the cost .\nA : so we've done an amazing job in coming up with what need need calculator for that .\nD : so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven .\nD : eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one .\nD : and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product .\nA : nick the cable back then .\nC : mixed up the colours little bit .\nA : do either of you want to say anything ?\nC : ps don't , we worked together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and , seemed to discuss things pretty and come to group consensus and .\nA : this this slide here the satisfaction with room for creativity , we've allowed ourselves as much creativity as the the the the product allows .\nA : won't comment on leadership , teamwork we've everybody's worked pretty together .\nA : we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , the results speak for itself and new ideas found , , again gi no given relatively everyday product , we've very very effectively come up with new new approach .\nA : are the costs within budget ?\nA : is the project evaluated ?\nA : we're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , very much , that that's we can go for an early bath .\nA : so call the meeting closed .\nA : not how far ahead of schedule we were there ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting by stating the agenda and then introduced the upcoming project to the

create new remote control for real reaction .\nA : as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have little training on tools , create plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total .\nA : the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\nA : that , steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness .\nA : the originality is gonna take all of us .\nA : the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , sarah .\nA : and we'll get on with it .\nA : so we'll have functional design individual work with meeting and then conceptual design and then detailed design .\nA : everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard .\nA : kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , and while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .\nB : if pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on .\nB : so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal .\nB : do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ?\nA : do not , it's just to try out the whiteboard .\nB : only animal could thin could draw .\nC : are we all gonna draw cat ?\nB : its bunny rabbit cat .\nB : you can tell it's not bunny rabbit by the ears .\nB : suppose it should have mouth as , , .\nA : and the characteristics ?\nB : the favourite characteristics of the cat the whiskers , because they're the easiest to draw .\nB : i'll give it some more , and the tail yes .\nA : since you're handy as , why don't you do yours next , steph .\nA : it's to get us used to using the pen .\nB : it's not to test our artistic it's mouse .\nC : that's not mouse-y , no .\nB : no it's not mouse .\nA : not mouse , rat .\nC : that's it's clothes .\nC : it's ratty with with with very long tail .\nA : and your favourite characteristics of that animal .\nC : they're intelligent and they're cheeky and fantastic pets and very friendly .\nC : and they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework .\nB : gosh , why didn't of fish ?\nB : that's even easier to draw than cat .\nD : this is very representational fish .\nD : like them because they're sleek and they have lot of freedom but they also do swim in groups , so .\nA : so they have team elements .\nD : do you have favourite one ?\nA : i'm afraid i'm with steph .\nA : and your pen's running out of whatever .\nA : but i'm afraid take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way .\nA : cats are sometimes very independent .\nA : my parents had cats .\nA : and they can decide for themselves what is best .\nA : now we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold we're to sell it for twenty five euros , with profit aim ultimately of fifty million euros .\nA : that tells you something about how many we have to sell on an international scale .\nA : would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , hundred million of them to make twenty five euros on each one and to make total profit of fifty million .\nA : the production is to only cost twelve and half euros per item .\nA : now if they cost twelve and half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and half euros each .\nA : and we're to make profit of fifty million , that's can you do the maths and how many are we selling ?\nD : was just wondering if that's the if fifty percent is normal .\nD : would think would be more like sixty percent .\nD : but let me have two thoughts .\nD : one hundred , fifty percent .\nD : and and your question is how many do we have to sell ?\nA : yes , 'cause our market is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big market you have to target and who is that .\nD : at twenty five .\nD : that's so that's four million of them ?\nA : to give you pretty good idea of where you're looking .\nA : something like that ?\nA : that's fifty million euros .\nA : in order to make fifty million euros , and you're only getting twelve and half each that's lot of selling .\nD : and if we make .\nA : two four to be fifty , be four million .\nA : you'd have to sell four million .\nA : experience with remote control .\nA : any of you use of remote control for television or d_v_d_ ?\nB : that that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for in home environment , for t_v_s and one that works would be good .\nA : you're both nodding , all three .\nA : 've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at time , but also have heard about them not working or not co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another .\nC : it is true that you always sit around , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the d_v_d_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else .\nA : and they don't always talk to each other .\nC : but presume this is presume this is just for television .\nA : are there any ideas for the remote ?\nA : what would it be for and what group would be be for ?\nA : we have to think about that one .\nD : we could make hello kitty themed remote .\nC : one in bright colours would be good .\nD : we could go for the japan-a-mation .\nD : there's also the cachet that the japanese make products .\nD : electrical their industrial design is very good .\nC : one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions .\nC : like i've got one at home that has , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , , subtitles , mute , there's lotta buttons that i've got no idea what they do , like .\nD : that's really good point , because one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to go to menus and then make choices , , so if it's like an volume button , , you can go in and say mute or or volume .\nD : we don't need to have like the the numbers if we also have channel up channel down .\nD : we can make it smart like an ipod , , make everything menus .\nC : closing the meeting .\nA : know this sounds like it was very quick , but the that's the industrial design is the first one , that's kate , for the working design .\nC : that was quick .\nA : and user , that's you steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification .\nA : there's going to be lot of we have to help each other and work through this as group , and we all , , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but we all have to like each other to get this done .\nA : as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but don't think they allowed lot of extra time , so little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead .\nA : do you all agree ?\nA : then don't see any reason to prolong it and we should finish this meeting at ni now and go into other things .\nA : alright , so this is the end of the first meeting ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert discussed user preferences in

</t> ", "A : it fell off .\nA : one , two , three , four , , we're ready .\nA : welcome to this second meeting .\nA : it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting .\nA : this is meeting on functional design .\nA : and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between .\nA : did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment .\nA : know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have .\nA : is this ap everybody agree with this ?\nA : and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions .\nA : but now for the minutes of the first meeting .\nA : and go to that one .\nA : as you can see it was this earlier today .\nA : kate , steph , sarah and myself in our four capacities were present .\nA : opened the meeting , the product was developed and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it .\nA : and it had some implications , the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese .\nA : and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting anybody have any questions on those minutes ?\nA : are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ?\nB : so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as .\nA : did miss something ?\nA : i'm afraid incorporated that when said who was present , but yes , we did , and we did little bit of team building of of making the pictures , but didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily .\nA : so as group we've are they're accepting the minutes .\nD : accept the minutes .\nD : is that what we're supposed to say ?\nA : then we'll move to the three presentations .\nA : we need to move this .\nA : who wants to go first ?\nA : that's as far as it goes .\nC : not really meant to touch those microphones .\nC : it doesn't have any on , does it ?\nB : oy , big loop under the table .\nA : she said we didn't need to screw it in .\nD : that looks good .\nA : it's doing its thing .\nA : there we are .\nD : one of the the biggest issues found about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these remote controls and that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you .\nD : so my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools .\nD : some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard .\nD : and if we devote some energy into this , the recent productions of real reaction , the go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , we can also use this as platform to make it interact with other tools .\nD : and the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the will only benefit from the positive feedback from our designed tool .\nD : so again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls .\nD : fifty percent of all these numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons .\nD : and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are lot of television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on remote control that looks fancy .\nB : could can ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've .\nD : it was market research and there were hundred people in the room , so eighty out of hundred said they would spend more money .\nA : now in between , as the project manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be that teletext is outdated and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for t_v_ with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .\nD : we can we can really focus on this remote and bring the real reaction brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't advertise for the go everywhere line .\nD : so an interesting element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question .\nD : so these market research questionnaires looked into your your concern about technology and specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition .\nD : now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in remote control .\nD : very interesting , leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this if and , the the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five , especially in terms of growth , this would be very smart group to target .\nA : is that large enough target market to target it ?\nD : three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and with the technologies improving , if we can get these .\nA : in real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?\nA : or eight million .\nD : but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did know that it was it was an that's that's very good question .\nD : if speech recognition should be should be included , but it's an interesting that shows more about being open to technology .\nB : how i'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things .\nC : it definitely needs lot more research on like how much more it would be and any , , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that thing .\nD : shall go back ?\nB : expect an industrial designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve euros fifty , is that lot or little ?\nD : did not receive any information on that , but the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because there is question about do you want an screen and and that wasn't responded to , but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , , so it turns into something perhaps you all have seen the osbournes where ozzy osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like small tray .\nD : it's and , no , no , you kate , you're exactly there .\nB : sh surely he's in the wrong age group .\nB : he must be one of small population .\nD : but the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and they'll be , .\nA : but we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , that's looking at age groups .\nD : yes , and i'm making and i'm making the the leap that people who are familiar younger people are are more familiar with technology than than older people .\nD : or comfortable , , so the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is up to the designers .\nA : you had the other power channel .\nD : and this is this is also supported by the market research .\nD : that's my contribution .\nA : and we'll turn to the next presentation .\nA : she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in .\nA : and then press , what ?\nA : f_n_ and eight .\nA : next to the control button on the bottom , and then eight at the top .\nA : and then be patient .\nC : here we go .\nB : and if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there .\nC : can not just do each one in order ?\nB : you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do no that one , that one there .\nA : there we are .\nB : left , left bit , left bit , that one , .\nB : and then you just press the click when you wanna go on .\nC : technical functions design .\nC : first off , do agree with what sarah has defined as as your personal preferences,yeah .\nC : we need more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions .\nC : so my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have .\nC : and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions the same as what existing remotes have .\nC : if we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something i'd thought about , but it's also something we can discuss .\nC : and and presume we can miss out the functions really to to video or d_v_d_ remote control , if this is only gonna be , , satellite , cable , t_v_ remote control .\nC : so these are two models of existing remote controls .\nC : the one on the left seems to be fairly standard universal remote control .\nC : it has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies .\nC : it also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from , , like sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of merely terrestrial one .\nC : but we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , don't think we need them .\nC : we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen .\nC : not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .\nA : and exceed the requirements they're expecting of us .\nC : so it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more text on the screen thing than than actual buttons was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and menu that you can access .\nC : but then do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility .\nA : any thing else you wanna add ?\nC : but we could go back to the pictures of the , what're they called ?\nC : the pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , but should hear what kate has to say first .\nA : let's hear what kate has to say .\nD : afterwards we could do whiteboard with that your the one on the as as basis .\nA : the white that one on the is , as as less cluttered , it's there but it's .\nC : definitely less cluttered and but still it's was just i'll just resume something else was gonna say .\nC : the the style of these is terrible .\nC : really think we need to not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised .\nD : the ergonomics , the way it fits in your .\nC : but so that's that for now .\nB : haven't actually got display on my screen .\nB : still , i'll do without that .\nB : now wanna bring us down to earth again i'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .\nB : and this is the methodology used in preparing for this meeting .\nB : i've been doing little bit of web-based research , and if had design team , would've been discussing my ideas with .\nB : but the the net result is that i've come up with first cut for the working design that i'd like to discuss with you .\nB : so , let's go back to what the basic function of remote control is .\nB : it's for sending message , typically via infrared .\nB : and the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are an energy source , the user interface and which will in incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into message , and then we need sending mechanism to send it to the receiver .\nB : now would have hoped that's my only slide actually , .\nB : would have have hoped to do you pretty powerpoint slide of my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me i'll do it on the whiteboard .\nB : so we want an energy source which is there .\nB : and we've got to think about what that might be .\nB : we don't want wires on this thing .\nB : typically it would be battery , but i'm open to suggestions .\nB : and then we have the the user interface .\nB : and the main components in there are the the the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver .\nB : so those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty .\nA : but those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ?\nA : what do the buttons look like ?\nA : what does it feel like ?\nA : that's where the user interface is really coming into its own .\nA : the technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong .\nA : the battery energy source or what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after certain amount of time , do you just replace it ?\nA : is there any because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for d_v_d_s , movies , whatever .\nA : does it have to have way of being segregated from the others , in different frequency ?\nB : may be wrong here , but i'd been thinking of this device as being cheap mass-produced device .\nB : we're trying to sell four million of , that's that's , , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is .\nB : and hadn't thought of it as being reparable thing , you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why i'm bit concerned .\nB : like the idea of speech recognition , that's idea , but i'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit .\nD : do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create device that has these basic elements ?\nD : because then no , the chip composer marketing .\nC : isn't that your job ?\nD : no , the chip composer sender .\nB : i'm i'm i'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , but .\nD : don't believe know , .\nA : what they cost .\nD : be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea .\nC : it does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is the same as these existing models , just little bit more inspired , but just the same .\nC : although what what suddenly came into my head is , how they always take two a_a_ batteries which which is really not very efficient .\nC : could it be possible to have , , like rechargeable internal battery , like , , like an m_p_ three player does ?\nC : with that you could jus or mobile phone or whatever .\nC : you could , you just plug into power source for couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing a_a_ batteries , which are you'd never need batteries would .\nD : that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on charger , then you then it has place .\nD : but it also has place , so exactly .\nC : and it's not stuck down the back of the sofa .\nC : but then again if this is within our price range or not .\nD : that's really good idea .\nB : think that's very interesting idea , but i'm not very good industrial designer and much about what these things cost .\nB : i'll do some research for the next meeting .\nD : t's better than my idea about solar , probably .\nB : solar may not be so good when you're watching t_v_ in the night , but , .\nC : is just so annoying how no , but just rechargeable internal battery would probably it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky a_a_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and .\nA : it would have to sor store up the energy and then use it .\nA : solar can do that .\nB : we may be talking quite heavy then .\nA : that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much .\nB : so do you think we might make that selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ?\nD : definitely , 'cause i'm thinking in terms of the loss and breakage of remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having home , nest , place to live , exactly .\nC : have its little dock that you could put it in .\nD : so if you can dock it , , you could argue that this is exactly .\nA : and the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent .\nC : still if it's quite within our price range .\nD : 'cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware .\nA : are we as to what our target group is though ?\nA : so that we'd be looking for the younger end .\nD : brought up some exactly , but you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ?\nD : these are the , exactly .\nB : was wondering that , because ag agree that there there're people with how can put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , but bu but what was gonna say was , although they they may be buying , , personal music devices and all that , are they necessarily buying t_v_ remote controls ?\nA : usually put more money than brains .\nD : i'll make note of that , kate .\nD : good , good comment .\nB : because they probably live in household that has t_v_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , .\nD : it might be good to know who , , who's actually buying televisions and are we in region where people have more than one television in home ?\nB : we've got big hill to climb here , haven't we ?\nB : we've gotta persuade people who've got remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead .\nA : or do we make that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ?\nA : we sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it .\nC : that's probably more what it is .\nA : what would be more efficient way of doing it ?\nD : and and some of our d_v_d_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers .\nC : we're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , are we ?\nA : the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions .\nA : our functions , we've so far decided , , that power , channel , volume make it attractive .\nA : it has to have an enter key and the number keys .\nA : it has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful .\nD : do we need let me br actually , the enter key have chart here that didn't include .\nA : is that agreeable to everyone ?\nD : which might , those are felt like had lot of charts .\nB : do you want the gizmo ?\nA : throw some light on that .\nA : actually we're , , we are almost half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing .\nD : my only comment is we could somehow include an enter key in like power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining .\nA : enter , power as sum simultaneous key .\nD : again , , thinking of menus or you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter so you press power after you've was thinking you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and power follows something like channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice .\nA : is that with you ?\nC : was miles away .\nB : how does that work ?\nC : was re was reading the chart to be honest .\nB : how so so how does that work , how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ?\nA : then you'd have to have an off te off key .\nB : it's not getting bit complicated ?\nB : could granny do this , or are we just not aiming at granny ?\nD : that has turning dial , where at the far end is on or off .\nC : who's got an ipod then ?\nD : anyway , that was the only comment about some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important .\nD : it's definitely channel , volume , power .\nC : things like screen settings and audio settings , would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have , little flap with little control panel on the actual box itself .\nC : wouldn't know how to do it using remote control , so would say that they are definitely less relevant .\nD : for looking at that .\nA : so easy to use is the other thing that we want to be able to do .\nD : we don't wanna outsmart .\nA : as you said , , don't make it too hard for the granny .\nA : joined that set last week .\nA : first grandchild arrived .\nA : so are we then of those things ?\nA : and let's go back to agenda and hook me up .\nA : this oughta be fun .\nA : it probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like mess .\nA : it lost it off here .\nA : no , it was up there , but couldn't see it down here .\nA : this time it should be both .\nA : there we go .\nB : how do you do that ?\nB : how do you make it do both ?\nA : you have to keep doing the financi the the f_n_ and eight to five minutes to finish , lot for telling me .\nB : it toggles through , .\nD : you have to cycle through .\nA : we're ready to close .\nA : will be completed questionnaire , then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research and i'll put some minutes of this meeting together .\nA : your individual assignments are for kate to do the components , for you , steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching .\nA : and each of us will get help from our coach .\nA : are we to get ourselves together and then have lunch ?\nA : then that's the end of this meeting .\nA : and hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end .\nC : we didn't come to any decision on the functions though .\nA : went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them .\nC : alright , that's fine then .\nA : that's what went over and nobody was objecting to them .\nD : and you'd mentioned was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it they were it has to be for t_v_ , just to keep myself , i've .\nA : the teletext is outdated , the internet is important , it's only to be for t_v_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan which is more in the user range , with steph .\nB : so we're still in meeting , aren't we ?\nC : what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ?\nA : it doesn't tell me .\nC : from their i'll just use it from their website ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing

we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point .\nA : and we should each have presentation to make .\nA : we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total .\nA : it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .\nA : there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in minute after take us to the minutes of the previous meeting .\nA : as we remember , opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved .\nA : sarah , you presented marketing research report which rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly speech recognition .\nA : and then steph did second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use .\nA : all of us with those things .\nA : kate presented working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and half pence cost .\nA : but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having docking place as selling point .\nA : and the new requirements that it for be for t_v_ only and that it include the so slogan and colour of the corporate design be included .\nA : the corporate image .\nA : so we that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers .\nA : alternatively it would be manufacturer to enclose it with the t_v_ , but it still should meet those parameters .\nA : and that the function we was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .\nA : at that point we that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for .\nA : and steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics .\nA : kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed .\nA : and was to type up these minutes and work on the final report .\nA : is this fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?\nA : so we're ready to close that and go back to our that one .\nA : we're up to the point of the go back .\nA : the three presentations .\nA : so we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah .\nA : is that alright with everybody else ?\nA : especially since kate asked to be last .\nA : sarah , i'm if misspelled your name , didn't know whether it was s_a_r_a_ or s_a_r_h_ .\nD : respond to either .\nA : you respond to whatever you get , ?\nA : did you do your hit , there it is .\nD : first thing want to address is one of the points that florence brought up , which was current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that stephanie showed us and and they're twenty to sixty euros , depending on branding .\nD : some of them that have higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end .\nD : but that with the current price that we're searching for , we're within , even on the lower end , of the of the market .\nD : but i'm going to move on to more interesting more vibrant things .\nD : so , investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my the theme of what was to work on was trend watch .\nD : and know that you all are distance from cutting edge marketing research , so , i'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here .\nB : i'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so spent on .\nD : what's hot , fruit and veg .\nD : and this is all over the catwalks , paris , milan , and i'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes .\nD : this is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , some would say approachable .\nD : and if we're to refashion our view of what we want in remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into simple handset .\nD : also did little research on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing .\nD : functional is out .\nD : and the fancy , and that's exactly the term , i'm i'm thinking polished , elegant , , innovative , but cut above .\nD : this is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative .\nD : this is interesting , 'cause in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but what's innovative is having it simple with with technologically superior fabrics or , , designed in interesting substances .\nD : ease of use .\nD : again , pretty low , it's the top three , but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important .\nD : so we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in series of fruit fruit themed sleeves .\nB : that's good idea .\nA : it sounds like the the covers that they use for the remote , , your your cell phone .\nD : was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned , , so , , something similar to summer dress .\nD : it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .\nD : they could be ini initially we could start with fruit that would suit long hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear .\nD : it could actually the sleeve could take up lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it .\nD : they could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own .\nD : so what we're talking about is changing .\nD : everyone has t_v_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit .\nD : that's what's hot on the catwalks .\nD : so , this is my this is what i'm thinking .\nA : in most families , don't isn't the remote is remote .\nD : but what this would allow is perhaps person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , i'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .\nC : so when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this .\nA : actually some households do have three and four t_v_s and they would have remote for each one , so .\nD : so this is an idea and , this is exactly what the research has has shown .\nD : so really open this up to any other feedback .\nD : this spongy fruit and veg .\nB : we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .\nB : spongy is gonna be difficult , i'm afraid .\nC : and as for as for budgeting as , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components .\nD : have my ear to the market , .\nC : is this to the market ?\nB : we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber .\nB : suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , .\nD : is spongiest , .\nD : that would add .\nB : was thinking titanium myself .\nC : was thinking titanium , was thinking it's just have been influenced by pictures of ipods , and they're also minimalist and shiny .\nD : they are and they they would fulfil the first priority , which is fancy .\nD : many of us would associate those with fancy .\nD : something else we could do is call it something that's fruit and veg oriented .\nD : we could call it the name .\nA : are we talking about the device itself or the or cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as separate product ?\nD : would be very simple product that would have spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable .\nA : perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as separate product .\nD : so that , , that might be and then we could keep it titanium .\nC : but it's pointless , isn't it ?\nA : would that be agreeable ?\nB : would it be helpful if described the components bit , because it would give you bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do .\nC : or possibly it might be more useful if kate went next .\nA : do you wanna be next or you want kate to go next ?\nA : we'll move the .\nC : you can even have them in different flavours as .\nC : so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , .\nD : or or smelly .\nD : scratchy was really thinking lot about the the imac gel gem tone .\nC : scratch and sniff .\nD : it's hot on the streets , .\nB : some of this you're gonna be little disappointed with some of the things have to tell you , but i'm afraid this is the real world .\nB : so i've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and i've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but i'm not that it's quite what you want .\nB : now this isn't very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of remote control .\nB : really need pen but does my mouse work ?\nB : can you see my little mouse pointer ?\nB : this is this is the remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface .\nB : and this is push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here .\nB : and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate .\nB : we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver .\nB : so wan wanna go through not not just addressing the the the points that you made , sarah , but doing my presentation in the order wrote it .\nB : so first of all wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source .\nB : we can have your bog standard double double batteries in replaceable little compartment .\nB : we can have hand wind-up , , which is quite an interesting concept for for remote control , but it is doesn't quite go with the the fruit and veg .\nB : one that one that is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite ni and neat one .\nA : remember , we only have forty minutes .\nB : you have to it means that if it's sitting there for long time it probably won't work , but you have to throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work .\nB : or we we had talked about solar power , but thing that we that that's not so good in the dark .\nB : now i'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case .\nB : it can be made of plastic , rubber , wood if you like , or titanium .\nB : and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there is rubber , but i'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and it can have flat surface , curved surface or double curved surface , but if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .\nB : what does the interface look like ?\nB : push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with .\nB : we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate push , so you can have it like on mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel like that and push to select something .\nB : you can have multiple scroll buttons , this is getting little bit complicated , but it's it the technology is there .\nB : and we can also incorporate an display in the remote , but this will increase the cost .\nB : the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this .\nB : if we want the cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons .\nB : all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i'm afraid .\nB : pay little bit more for regular chip and you can have scroll buttons .\nB : if you want the advanced chip it costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the display .\nB : and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices .\nB : now what that is , but they t's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere .\nB : ou our real expertise is in push buttons , have to say , but you think that's old technology .\nB : and we've got two options .\nB : we can either go for really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , which means flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons .\nB : or we can have something that looks bit nicer , it , won't necessarily look like pineapple , but that may or may not be good thing .\nB : but it could have an screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker .\nD : that sounds good .\nD : any idea you you mentioned that there would be cost difference .\nD : do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ?\nB : i'm afraid don't have that information available .\nB : manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , i'm afraid .\nD : because , what , i'm being quite serious when say that that the things mentioned are hot .\nD : but the important thing might be to choose one .\nD : if if what you're telling me is is some of these things aren't just aren't feasible , we could something about naming , we could call it , , blackberry .\nD : that's alright , let's see then .\nC : bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with logo on it .\nC : but how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company .\nC : it's just what i'd understood we'd be doing .\nC : that's before heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .\nD : but , i'm trying to streamline mine little bit .\nB : we we could we could do double curved rubber one , which would allow say banana , but unfortunately see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier .\nC : shall we 'til i've 'til i've showed you what , my extensive presentation on what interfaces are available .\nC : you did seem to include just in more detail what i've got though .\nC : so so mine's bit pointless .\nC : f_n_ and eight , did you say ?\nA : there we go .\nC : don't have it on mine though .\nD : florence resolved it by eight again .\nB : if you do f_n_ eight again , it's it'll it , you you will do an .\nA : do it again .\nA : keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both .\nC : should do it again ?\nA : this time it should come up both .\nC : don't actually have huge amount of different information then what kate says , just that my method was to look at the , , my my inspirations , which was big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use similar thing , including m_p_ three players , like , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .\nC : having think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece .\nC : i've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , which , couldn't find the picture of the ipod only linked to web browser , so couldn't copy and paste it , but it had similar thing to this thing on the .\nC : it has scroll wheels without without display , but they they scroll like computer mouse .\nC : so was thinking that really simple really simple interface with just couple of scroll things on it and then instead of display the display could appear on the television screen .\nC : like an existing sky or cable one does .\nC : like , , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen .\nC : but i'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , which is really and fun and good to hold and , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective .\nC : so what seems ideal for me would be to just have fairly simple , not fancy but not minimalist , just pretty simple plastic , probably , was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to screen that would appear on the television screen , like , , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .\nC : and when you've got screen sitting there in front of you , you might as have it appearing on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .\nC : and so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .\nB : i'd i'd certainly support that idea .\nC : and and definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber .\nC : titanium would be , but it might be bit too expensive and too kinda spacey .\nC : if we're trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then titanium's too futuristic .\nB : it's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as , we can't have double curved case in titanium unfortunately .\nC : whereas plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .\nC : then and it's little bit pointless as .\nB : and the the having the the the screen on the television screen is good idea , 'cause otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the in , but for the electronics as .\nC : like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , just little menu showing , menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the , your information about programme that's on at the moment .\nB : there is that .\nC : don't think that's to taxing to engineer .\nC : but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one .\nC : and quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely spaced out , so something bit like that with buttons arranged in circle .\nC : up , down , left , .\nB : do you want scroll buttons in that as ?\nC : was thinking not actually scroll , like like mouse scroll , but , 't quite describe it .\nC : you see on the one on the , down at the bottom , is the mouse .\nC : see where the mouse is , like this style thing where you have up , down , left and .\nC : and enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into new menu for that .\nC : i'm getting bit specific here .\nC : really we'd have to use something to show you , but if don't think get it up on the screen .\nB : that's clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .\nD : to make it .\nC : here we go .\nC : the ipod spinning wheel is really complicated .\nC : it does scroll , but it is hugely complicated .\nC : what else have we got ?\nC : them , they're terrible .\nC : but they all have this this feature of this it's not quite scroll wheel , but it's selection in this circle , which is really good idea .\nA : it's selection wheel .\nB : but we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .\nC : like up , down , left and .\nC : which is good .\nC : and then and then , so either channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down .\nC : so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .\nC : and that's it .\nC : look at look at this one .\nC : almost impossible to misplace or or lose .\nD : do you think with it seems that that you are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote .\nC : might take up your whole living room .\nD : do you think we could put it in in fruit colour ?\nD : and have it abstract .\nD : we could call like fruit name , but it would be little more abstract .\nC : that also is possible .\nB : we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy .\nD : i'm just just throwing out ideas .\nC : just just something else need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on remote ?\nA : or call it or call it banana and have it in yellow .\nD : i'm thinking we need to be little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so .\nC : this is actually the volume up and down , but they both say v_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the v_ to indicate that it's the volume , so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .\nC : but we wouldn't have specific volume up and down .\nC : if we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .\nC : but then , that's complicated .\nA : wanna all for all your presentations .\nA : we have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts .\nA : and you all have been self-stimulating of working together .\nA : we need to come up with some specifics of the components , the materials , things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things .\nA : they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we've discussed were battery , kinetic or solar .\nA : this is where kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be little bit guided by kate at this point .\nA : the you were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it as opposed to battery that you have to either put it in recharger or keep replacing the batteries .\nA : or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it .\nA : that's the day you wanna use the t_v_ .\nA : so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?\nB : unfortunately don't have costing information .\nB : in terms of workability , the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but i'm don't figures on the difference in cost .\nA : what's the feelings of the group on the kinetic ?\nD : i've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very handy , you don't even notice that it's there .\nC : i've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic .\nC : sounds like it could be really good economical it would make the whole thing lot lighter , more convenient .\nD : it could tie in with the fanciful design as , , throw the banana , , just gotta keep it moving .\nC : 'cause it's really quite attractive thought , isn't it ?\nC : it's like , good selling point .\nA : so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's possible .\nC : but it does depend how much how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .\nB : and and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause i'm conscious that watching t_v_ can be quite sed sedentary activity .\nD : but could market that as as was thinking actually cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , .\nC : do your exercises while you're watching the t_v_ .\nB : true , , more more environmentally friendly .\nC : that's what was thinking as .\nD : the that's exactly what was thinking .\nA : for the reminder for five minutes to finish , .\nA : the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as decision .\nB : , i'd that that's something should have covered .\nB : chip on print is just manufacturing technique and would certainly recommend it , , because i'm not have an alternative .\nB : it it's just the way that the the the the way it's ac it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper .\nA : what about the ca .\nA : the way we .\nA : what about the case ?\nA : they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and we've discussed not having titanium .\nA : one , it's too expensive , and second , it won't do this double curves .\nA : we've eliminated wood .\nA : we said plastic or rubber .\nA : what's the pleasure ?\nB : if sarah's keen on spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's .\nA : what about you ?\nC : do you not might need like hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then spongy , thick spongy cover , so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it .\nD : like an internal egg .\nC : because you could just get carried away with the with the tac .\nB : i'd i'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but agree , it's sounds like idea if it is .\nC : you do get bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , and just copy the one on the left .\nD : and with sports on television .\nA : the next part they want is the user interface concept .\nD : su then i'll just say support either from marketing point of view support either decision that the designers make on that .\nB : should should which technically is just push button and i'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on .\nA : i'm to push you , but we only have couple minutes to finish with .\nA : and it says interface .\nA : what type and what supplements ?\nC : no scroll , like four buttons , up , down , left and with enter in the middle , that will correspond to menu on the screen .\nC : i'd like push buttons with so push buttons no , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually .\nA : this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes .\nA : and they actually want look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as as .\nA : marketing they want product evaluation .\nD : no we can't , actually .\nA : my , i'm .\nD : that's why was looking over your shoulder .\nA : missed that one .\nA : this ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work .\nC : now it's gone again .\nB : the the company's next project should to design better overhead device that switches immediately .\nA : yes , because 't even see mine .\nA : next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions .\nA : the look and feel design is for kate , steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation .\nA : the two of you get to play with pla modelling clay to do prototype .\nA : and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way .\nA : anything else we need to do ?\nA : go to it .\nA : and that's the end of this meeting .\nA : that's for her benefit .\nD : that's really all got , ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design. </t>  <t> The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons. </t>  <t> The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology. </t>  <t> The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness, technological

open .\nB : keep forgetting whether i've done this .\nA : we'll open that when the time is .\nA : in the meantime closing things down , .\nA : let's see what this thing does .\nA : does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ?\nA : we came up together , we're good .\nA : are we ready to start ?\nA : it's now quarter of four .\nA : this is another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five .\nA : our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to sarah present the evaluation criteria .\nA : we then have finance aspect , which is spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet .\nA : and you're all thinking of , my , because we're only given forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation .\nA : so we're going to make very fast track .\nA : and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing .\nA : so the first thing have to do is close this so that get to where is it ?\nA : need to open mine .\nA : not the agenda .\nA : no that want the minutes from the previous minutes .\nA : that should be there , minutes .\nA : from meeting three , is it alright with you if don't switch it to show , just use it as is ?\nA : 'cause this way more easily flip it .\nA : all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , each of you made your presentations .\nA : we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations .\nA : the market trend of fruit and veg , spongy , fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy .\nA : we decided chip on print would be used .\nA : we would use plastic with rubber casing , was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy .\nA : there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight .\nA : perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that .\nA : looking like scroll , but it's really push button technology , excuse my spelling that was actually in use , that is behind the scenes is push button which we according to kate have very good grasp on doing that in production .\nA : we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be separate product that could be suggested to management .\nA : and as suggested yellow with black buttons with the company logo , slogan and image might be good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us .\nA : we did have few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time .\nA : we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one .\nA : and we closed as it ran out of time .\nA : is that fair presentation of what happened ?\nA : back to this meeting .\nA : we're down to the prototype presentation .\nA : over to you .\nC : you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough .\nC : this is the one that made .\nC : it is curved , easy to hold , hand-held , and small with big easy buttons .\nC : this is like scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus .\nC : we need someone who's experienced with the television .\nC : this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television .\nC : i'm not quite how to make that , but i'm it will work .\nC : this is on off switch , 'cause we do need that , and it gives it balance .\nC : and it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it in there .\nC : as for what it's actually made of the function of these buttons is up , down , left and in the different menus .\nC : position , presume that just means on it , easy to see .\nC : the main feature of it is just simple design , simple , lack of buttons all over the place .\nC : form curved , smooth , hand-held , makes it feel to hold .\nC : material , kate's gonna tackle that quite bit , but we have two different options , because we did make another one , which wa is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of banana , which is also and easy to hold and feels good and has similar scroll push button technology , just slightly different design .\nC : also with on off switch and infrared had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic .\nC : so like , , what's it like ?\nC : like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth .\nC : whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .\nC : so we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints .\nC : and what we , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it .\nC : material , that's what have to say about material .\nC : can scroll down on there and see what else colour , definitely have preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , i'm quite willing to consider them as .\nC : so , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if i'm , , kate , you better say what you think about them .\nB : don't have very much to add .\nB : the the case , that's the on off button just come off our prototype .\nB : the the case can be either spongy rubber or hard plastic .\nB : we're not about combination of the two , but it can be either of those .\nB : we have the technology to do that .\nB : and as for the the actual components , steph just said this is quite cheap device to manufacture .\nB : we have simple rubber push buttons which provide all the functionality we need .\nB : the the diode that actually does the infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version .\nB : so that's for material .\nB : colour , steph's the expert on colour .\nB : we we don't have any particular restrictions on that .\nB : that's all we've got to say really .\nC : thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , this one is fruit shaped .\nC : this one has banana , .\nC : this one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like , you'd expect it to be like child's sorta toy remote control instead of real one , which quite like that image .\nC : 'cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and hold them , you see , .\nB : would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?\nC : curvature , is it to your liking ?\nA : see , the on-off's in the back .\nB : yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it .\nC : if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all .\nA : and then you can use your thumb .\nB : and it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in different place .\nA : could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having problem with the .\nC : you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid .\nD : like the fact that on both of them the keys play such prominent role .\nC : we really like we really like that design , it looks just like logo , that arrangement of the keys .\nC : like like compass point , , just up , down , left and , and we think we could make that quite good feature .\nC : and it's like the the ipod scroll wheel , but better .\nD : but it's also like texting , you don't .\nC : , it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , was try was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ?\nB : and it's very simple design , there's not lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make .\nD : it's also in terms of being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different .\nD : have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to , this is really identifiable .\nC : the thing is we do need to develop our technology of actually how to program the menus and what , , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's viable option .\nA : the next item is evaluation .\nA : if that's if you're finished .\nD : shall take your power ?\nD : this is going to be heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department .\nD : so , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by the consumers as as incorporate all of our insight into this evaluation exercise .\nD : so i'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and i've made list of criteria to look at , and so i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and i'm gonna now use the the board .\nD : so fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other .\nD : and hope that you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap .\nC : what about price , is that gonna go on there as ?\nC : price of materials .\nD : we'll put price up at the top .\nC : not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend .\nA : will soon , unfortunately .\nD : so did you say ?\nD : so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?\nC : it depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when of fancy , of it's got lots of extra fripperies and , , like baroque curliness and which i'd call these quite minimalist , simple and plain , but do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy .\nB : yes , plain , simple , clean design .\nD : so in that respect we'll go with that respect .\nC : just we need different word other than fancy , i'd say aesthetic .\nB : have got trendy further down , but elegant , if i'd call them elegant .\nD : no these aren't the exact terms that the .\nC : like stylish or aesthetic .\nD : we're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is .\nD : that the is fancy .\nC : did you just break the pen ?\nD : so let's let's take it to the next level .\nC : we'll just call it fancy then .\nD : so in terms of elegant , fancy .\nD : we'll call it e_f_ , do we do we think that perhaps and we should say the yellow ?\nD : should we go with the yellow in terms of that's really superior they're both .\nC : we we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black .\nC : so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just purely blob or some abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as banana , , with the grooves and the stalk and , so .\nD : that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .\nD : and of the two really like like the banana , but do like the chunk .\nC : so that's not something we have to decide just now , is it .\nD : no , but in terms we have to evaluate one of them .\nC : just somewhere long the scale of in between these two .\nD : unless do you wanna evaluate both ?\nA : between the two , somewhere between the two is true .\nB : i'd don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept .\nA : it's more true than false , about two .\nD : so we say true .\nB : we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .\nD : so we'll say we'll say false .\nD : easy to use .\nD : one , is that inappropriate ?\nD : trendy , and say specifically spongy fruity .\nC : only two or three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific , don't really think that's gonna work , but no .\nB : we have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as banana but spongy .\nD : are there excess buttons ?\nB : so that's false .\nD : that is false .\nD : good , designed buttons , intuitive buttons .\nA : better , more intuitive buttons , yes .\nD : people don't respond to ugly .\nD : sellable , quirky , , something people like , .\nB : they're different , aren't they ?\nC : is quite it is quite quirky .\nC : it could be quite good brand , like good little object .\nD : and was was thinking of other things in terms of could we say it's cost saving ?\nD : with the , with the energy .\nC : we also need tho think about the energy .\nC : is it the kinetic energy ?\nC : if it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .\nD : it is going to be kinetic ?\nD : we'll we'll say it's cost saving enviro .\nC : but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely about that , but .\nD : you're still in the play-doh stage .\nD : including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ?\nB : our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop .\nB : we haven't got lot of expensive components in there .\nA : yes , the instinct says true .\nD : so true one or should go to two or three ?\nB : i'd put it at one , but , what do you , true , it might be the , , true .\nC : would say two , 'cause we still we need to get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things .\nC : it's not just like it's not like ev , on normal chunky remote every button res means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in .\nA : that's not cheap thing to get .\nB : that's good point .\nC : we need somebody to develop that .\nD : anything else you can thing of ?\nD : and i'm gonna actually change couple of these so then i'm gonna instead of ugly i'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause have to do an average .\nD : and then excess buttons .\nC : just putting no excess buttons .\nD : we're doing really .\nD : be , so it doesn't ruin the polarity .\nC : as for see if we're technologically innovative , i'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons .\nC : know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market .\nD : you let me if any of these if you if you all can think of any other thing to change here if you if you should change the innovative or add other features .\nD : if not i'll average those .\nD : so , how about if pass this back to you and i'll figure out the average here .\nA : we're little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance .\nD : for everyone's help with that .\nA : and as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank goodness .\nA : and we're going to raise what's called sp spreadsheet that they provided to me .\nA : and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .\nA : hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .\nC : just kinetic then , .\nA : what's hand dynamo ?\nB : that was the crank , wind-up crank on the side .\nC : it's the wind-up .\nA : shoot , forget that .\nA : kinetic is and how many of those will we need per we only need one .\nA : electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .\nB : we can do it all with simple just checking that .\nB : simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest .\nA : and we only need one of those .\nA : the case will be uncurved and flat or single curve or double curve .\nA : it looks like it single curve , 'cause of the chunkiness .\nA : it's that's one .\nB : that that one is single curve , isn't it ?\nB : do we have you it means you reverse the curve .\nC : what does double curved mean , don't understand .\nA : and that's that's the the one that goes like this .\nC : no , we don't need that .\nB : do don't think we need that for either of them , you can do banana in single curve , .\nC : single-curved , i'd say .\nA : no , single curve .\nA : case material supplements .\nA : plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour .\nC : wanna say plastic .\nA : we had the special colour .\nA : and did we say plastic ?\nB : can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , .\nD : one , two , three , four , five , six .\nA : we'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are .\nA : interface button push button interface .\nC : it's just button .\nA : that's what we're using , isn't it ?\nB : do we need to say how many buttons , or or is it just one ?\nA : whoops , don't want that , not yet .\nA : no , it just says push button interface .\nA : button supplements , they'll be in special colour of black .\nA : and the buttons wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?\nB : they'll be rubber , .\nA : so we need one of them .\nA : and are they any special form ?\nC : like the compass point one .\nB : actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not special material ?\nB : 'cause they can be plastic .\nA : 'cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top .\nB : they could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got double curved case .\nC : they could be plastic .\nA : let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement .\nB : it's just one , isn't it ?\nA : we only need one of them .\nA : and the total cost has been calculated as nine pounds twenty out of the twelve and half we were allowed .\nB : what , we're in .\nA : i'm going to save this into our desktop , project documents .\nA : as our project document bit .\nB : do you do you need to double click on that to open it ?\nA : there we are .\nA : that's the only excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us .\nA : so , are they under twelve fifty ?\nA : yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide .\nA : the project process , satisfaction with , , the room for creativity .\nA : leadership , teamwork , means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that good things .\nB : , the play-doh was best , .\nC : 'cause it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , quite want this , but imagine it rounder .\nC : so much better just to go and , , this is it , this is what we want .\nA : so , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above .\nA : did we find any new ideas ?\nD : with the marketing element of fruit shaped that really opened my eyes .\nD : only speak for myself though .\nC : and i'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , so .\nC : good work as design team , because we yes .\nB : we're good team actually .\nB : i'm not all the wires are really though .\nA : so we actually worked as group .\nA : are the costs within the budget ?\nA : is the project evaluated ?\nD : give you number , it's the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means , spell it out .\nB : hang on , we haven't heard .\nD : there were six true or ones , four pardon me , two almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two .\nD : would say that's ex excellent in terms of ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the market place .\nC : and the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep simple old technology , which if it works perfectly see no point in improving on if it works , so .\nD : to maintain old technology , exactly .\nB : and it's kept us within budget .\nC : so we do count as excellent or one .\nA : and we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , have final report to present , and then we're done .\nA : we done good , and we're finished in time .\nC : bring on the ice sculptures .\nB : and then we get the product launch party .\nD : so we might have to .\nB : product launch party ?\nC : that's what said , ice sculptures .\nD : one thing want to do is , the meeting's done .\nC : is that the end of the meeting ?\nA : believe that is the end of our meeting .\nD : one thing wa wanna do is save everything in the files , because don't think everything is saved ."], ["<t> The project

just take moment .\nA : or it won't .\nA : we'll have to deal with it like this then .\nA : this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product .\nA : i'm heather , i'm your project manager .\nA : so that was the opening .\nA : the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another .\nA : if everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name .\nB : my name's poppy .\nB : i'm the industrial designer for this project .\nB : i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase .\nB : also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product .\nA : to meet you poppy .\nC : my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer .\nC : will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design .\nD : hi , i'm genevieve .\nD : i'm the marketing expert .\nD : i'm an expert at marketing .\nD : i'll be telling you about the user requirement specifications for our new product .\nD : i'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase .\nA : alright i'm heather and i've said i'm your project manager , you can read what it is that i'm doing .\nA : and tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , as as planning the project , how we're going to , , create this product , and , , discuss , , our aims and objects of this , which brings us to our next subject , is , , , as team we're going to be designing and creating new remote control .\nA : we want this to be marketable product that can be trendy , , completely new style , so that , , can really appeal to , to generation that doesn't want simple plain , , channel-changer .\nA : and , , it needs to be user-friendly for , , , for an example , for people that , , can't see the numbers as , or , , perhaps an ergonomic design .\nB : so this is television remote control ?\nA : yes , it's television remote control .\nA : believe should be taking minutes on this now .\nA : so , alright .\nA : the way that we're going to go about this is , , we'll have time where we can , come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in meeting and , and discuss what , what , what functional design we want to use .\nA : same with conceptual design and detailed design .\nA : so , , making that it , it's usable , that as , and that it's , it's feasible to create , and , to come up with concept of it want , what we want it to look like .\nA : is , is everyone , .\nB : got those notes .\nA : one thing that , , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project .\nA : one of them is our whiteboard .\nA : and , , as team-building moment , , , i'd like us to , , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal .\nA : why that , why that should be your favourite animal .\nA : so , , , i'm assuming that we should do that now .\nA : with our microphones still attached to our bodies .\nA : what's my favourite animal ?\nA : do come up .\nB : to go first .\nB : are we all doing it individually ?\nA : this is team-building time where , , , , my favourite animal , which changes all the time , , now it is an elk .\nB : let's stand up and support you .\nA : alright , so and it goes like it's got like big antlers , .\nC : vicious we have sheep .\nA : looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head .\nB : do you have elk where you come from ?\nA : we have moose and we have deer .\nD : we have moose too .\nA : do you have , .\nD : uh-oh , we have good artist .\nC : that is really good .\nC : i'm quite very good .\nA : this is my .\nA : that's sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal now , 'cause it is large beautiful majestic creature , that , that in way it looks awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it but it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has strong antlers , and it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's it's an herbivore but , , it can really defend itself .\nA : i'm gonna take minutes while , , you express your favourite animals .\nB : i'll go next .\nB : am big animal lover .\nB : like all sorts of animals , but for the moment i'm gonna draw cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently .\nB : it's gonna be bit of strange drawing , but never mind .\nB : not as artistic as heather's drawing .\nB : bit more cartoon style .\nB : but like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing .\nB : but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , , running around outside as as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so and they just they're doing .\nB : reckon they're , they got it sorted .\nB : they they want .\nB : that's why like cats .\nB : i'll rub that out .\nB : there you go .\nC : my favourite animal would be dog , but i'm not really how to draw one .\nC : i've never drawn dog , don't think .\nC : i'm tempted to draw snail 'cause draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw .\nC : it's gonna be really funny dog , 'cause i'm not how to draw dog .\nA : forget her name .\nD : tara or tara .\nB : there are loads of different types of dogs , so i'm it'll represent one dog .\nC : it's cartoon dog .\nC : don't ev , .\nC : it's scary cartoon dog .\nC : that this , that does not look like dog .\nA : it looks kinda like person .\nB : we can pretend .\nC : how do you draw dog ?\nC : suppose it has lon my .\nC : yous it's supposed to be .\nC : like dogs because , , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals .\nC : and , like they're more of companion than cats .\nC : i've nothing against cats .\nC : cats don't really like me , so 't like them .\nC : but they're just so friendly and warm and animals , that don't look like that .\nD : feel like robot .\nD : had the most time to think about it .\nD : i'm going to draw butterfly , because saw butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of spring arriving .\nD : and it was actually the prettiest butterfly i've ever seen out in the wild , and though that was pretty in scotland .\nD : it was like , was little pointier than that .\nD : at first it was dead leaf .\nD : and then it landed on the wall next to me .\nD : but this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this .\nD : and then it kinda there was green , it was green ring , and there was like red going out like this .\nA : it's kinda like peacock .\nD : it kinda was actually , 'cause it was this part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and i'm like , this is the middle of scotland in like march .\nD : so that was pretty .\nD : and it landed by wall and let me look at it for about two minutes .\nD : wish i'd had my camera .\nD : so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here .\nD : there you go .\nD : what do we .\nA : do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?\nA : so , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , , the next , , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , or not meet our budget but more , , like what , , selling range we'll be looking at , , wanna make this selling price of twenty five euros .\nA : and so we have to , , come up with way to , to create , remote control , where we can like the price to create it will be significantly less .\nA : we'd like to , to , , make fifty million euro .\nA : i'm assuming that's what the m_ means .\nA : and make it for an international market .\nA : one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , , like different kinds of , , v_c_r_s .\nA : things like that , depending on which country you are .\nA : another thing for the design team to think about .\nA : we want it to cost , , absolute maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents .\nD : so we'll have hundred percent profit then ?\nA : i'm bad at math .\nA : so now that , , that is underway , it is discussion time .\nA : so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any suggestions that you may have so far , your personal experiences with remote controls , and , , areas you see that , , could be improved in your experience with them .\nA : does anyone have any initial thoughts ?\nD : find that in the dark it's often hard to button you're pushing .\nA : so what's something we could , , do to remedy that ?\nB : always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing .\nB : it's always , where is the remote control ?\nB : so if you could have some tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was .\nB : you can press button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost .\nC : do yous not find that , , like , there's lot of , , buttons on your remote control , and you what half of them do .\nB : that you don't use half of them .\nC : what they do .\nD : there's some remote controls where there's hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming .\nB : that's , that's , it is .\nD : so you just have like the number buttons , power button , t_v_ video button .\nA : anything about , , the look of the , , remote control that you might have ideas about .\nA : it could be , instead of like standard rectangular shape , it could be , , something more interesting like any ideas will do that you have at this point .\nD : could be shaped like conch , .\nD : be like shell-shaped remote .\nA : can hold it .\nB : are we going into novelty factors here .\nB : like , i've seen phones like .\nA : it's trendy original , , aspect we're going for .\nA : you're the designers , you , you can decide what , , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .\nB : suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite universally accepted thing .\nB : like , novelty thing might only sell few things rather than , like , general more acceptable but we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either .\nA : and the key issue here is , is being trendy and original .\nA : that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous .\nA : we have five minutes left .\nA : so , just to cover we have one more thing .\nA : like you can go over your ideas , , in your own personal times .\nA : our next meeting will be in half an hour .\nA : so you have half an hour to , , think about what you want to present .\nA : or not present but bring to the meeting .\nA : i_d_ , whatever that stands for .\nA : have to remember these things .\nA : you'll be beginning your , your working design .\nA : u_i_d_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes .\nA : how this can be achieved , and , , we need the user requirements from the manag marketing expert .\nA : you will get specific instructions , , of what to do in the next half an hour .\nA : and i'll see you in half an hour , ?"], ["<t> The project manager opens the meeting, asking the industrial designer to present first. </t>  <t> The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working

minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today .\nA : so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation .\nA : and , so , ?\nA : so , , take it away poppy .\nB : do need to plugged in .\nA : it's , it's plugged in .\nA : so , no problem .\nB : will take this time just to apologise .\nB : only , , received my emails later on .\nB : 'cause was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not not very good part of team-working thing .\nB : but there we go .\nA : i'm it's fine .\nB : so was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do .\nB : and it needs to allow person to have portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .\nB : they don't need to actually manually touch the television set .\nB : so , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be .\nB : from , on functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique .\nB : one is the visibility in the dark , which was genevieve's idea .\nB : so we need to think about how we could bring this in technically .\nB : and we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using mobile phone , or something fam familiar .\nB : automatically , lights up at first touch .\nB : or we could use fluorescent materials which would just take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark .\nB : also we could use an alarm .\nB : so if we lost the remote control , perhaps there could be button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room .\nB : behind cushion or somewhere .\nB : so that would work .\nB : go back there .\nB : another thing we missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .\nB : from previous researches i've carried out on other projects , we've learnt about smart materials where specific alloys of metals have shape memory .\nB : so they can be heated and and cooled , and they change the shape of the metal .\nB : so , , screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart .\nB : so , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , everything would spring apart .\nB : so , all the individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and that would be very important for products now .\nB : especially 'cause there's much responsibility for all the companies who are coming up with like new designs .\nB : 'cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .\nA : , one question .\nA : this , , self-destructible metal , it allows for recycling materials ?\nA : so that , , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?\nB : they would , you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy .\nB : and that's the part that would allow all the other parts to be separated at the end .\nB : the user would return the product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made .\nB : and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal .\nB : something like the case , if it's scratched , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .\nA : would we be the company that would break down these , or metals ?\nA : or would we contribute to another group ?\nB : you could we could probably empl employ , side company to do that for us .\nB : but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made .\nB : for certain percentage at least .\nB : not every , not hundred percent of everything we produce , but .\nA : this sounds like really idea .\nA : one thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .\nA : so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive .\nA : you would have to hire number of people , and it might be more expensive .\nB : the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de deconstructed .\nB : like , you don't have to individually unscrew all the screws .\nB : because of this , their properties are smart material .\nB : all you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .\nB : so suppose it does need like high contact , , high quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but .\nA : we'll still have to investigate the financial implications .\nA : like the environmental approach .\nA : we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as .\nB : also there is components .\nB : this'll be how it will actually work .\nB : but haven't put this plan together yet .\nA : i'm , could you those were .\nB : there we go .\nB : should go back .\nB : this would actually show the circuit diagram .\nB : although haven't come up with the final circuit yet .\nB : so put all those components in .\nA : so those are what , , we'll construct the remote .\nA : those are all the alright .\nB : it just shows what energy source .\nB : it could be battery , like rechargeable probably .\nB : an' , how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .\nB : so , now is it eight again to escape ?\nB : there we go .\nA : and , , the next presenter will be tara .\nB : there you go tara .\nC : can you see ?\nC : do you it , function eight ?\nB : the one at the top .\nC : i'm the user user interface designer .\nC : the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have .\nC : in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set .\nC : by taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international .\nC : there're two functional design options .\nC : multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices .\nC : and single function remote control , used specifically for the television .\nD : i'm , what was that last one .\nD : multifunctional and ch , see .\nC : single function just for the television itself .\nC : multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing .\nC : single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .\nC : that single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use .\nC : it'd be more compatible with range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable .\nC : it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design .\nC : and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic .\nC : and less functions would have to be included .\nC : so it would be cheaper to make .\nC : and probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with wider range of devices .\nC : does anyone have any questions ?\nD : so as far as we know , , single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?\nC : it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it compatible with different brands of devices .\nC : and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , , other entertainment devices .\nD : d_v_d_s and v_c_r_ ?\nA : does everyone agree with this ?\nA : does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be better way to go ?\nB : was just wondering about the , what , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing .\nB : and that would probably , , , ll what you said before about it being more profitable simplistic design .\nB : suppose having that would complicate it lot more .\nB : and limit the design .\nB : do you think ?\nD : agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , , we're gonna go over budget for one thing .\nC : and with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make more original design .\nC : we'll have more money to go into the design side of it .\nA : alright , , , are you ready for your presentation genevieve ?\nA : except you're not hooked up to the .\nD : i'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .\nD : lost my microphone .\nA : no problem , we can i'm , what was that last thing that you just said ?\nD : so i'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control .\nD : and i'll give you little briefing on what that means exactly .\nD : if you all remember from the email we got before our very first kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ?\nD : the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly .\nD : so what i'll be talking about now is the equivalent for remote control .\nD : so what needs and desires are to be fulfilled .\nD : i've done some marketing research , lot of interviews with remote control users , , and some internet research .\nD : and i'll show you my findings .\nD : and firstly wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose .\nD : so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products .\nD : hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics .\nD : so that should be our priority here .\nD : and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design .\nD : not just in electronic fashion .\nD : so that it's something that fits in the household .\nD : we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design .\nD : any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , who's famous , what t_v_ shows are being watched , , to influence our remote control .\nD : so the findings .\nD : seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly .\nD : which is , quite significant number .\nD : the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , , neutral .\nD : eighty percent of users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .\nD : current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .\nA : i'm , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .\nA : you mean that they would spend more money on fancy-looking remote control ?\nD : they're willing , they're willing to spend money on remote control with personality .\nD : as opposed to your basic , , oval black , all same size button remote control .\nD : so it is something that people care about .\nD : it's not , it's not ignored in the household .\nD : seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap lot .\nD : zapping meaning they go through channels lot .\nD : and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .\nD : that very small amount .\nD : thought that was interesting .\nA : alright , so it might be very appealing if , , we have very concise buttons .\nB : the single function .\nA : and another thing with lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be lot more durable , because find with channel-changers that , , lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .\nB : that's good point .\nD : and actually to go with that , i'm gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used .\nD : and how important the users find them .\nD : so the power button , , in an hour is only used once .\nD : hopefully the person's not turning on and off the t_v_ .\nD : but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten .\nD : so people wanna be able to turn on the t_v_ with the remote control .\nD : as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set .\nD : channel selection is used hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour .\nD : that's huge amount .\nD : this is the most important button .\nD : so when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want durable button that's not gonna run down .\nD : relevance of that button , our users found was ten , ten out of ten .\nD : ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten .\nD : and it's used on average four times an hour .\nD : not as much as channel selection , but still significant .\nD : audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour .\nD : relevance is two .\nD : screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour .\nD : and relevance of one point five .\nD : we're getting to specific statistics here .\nD : teletext , , now i'm not too clear on what that is .\nD : if you can help me .\nD : is that so like running banner , underneath .\nC : it's it has t_v_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment .\nB : it's like the news .\nB : or like information .\nB : the and what's on .\nA : it's no it's button that you press , and then you , , like menu pops up .\nC : no , li .\nA : haven't used it before but .\nB : it's like it's like very basic internet .\nC : and you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .\nC : very basic internet , .\nB : , it's just information that , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and .\nC : but you have .\nD : like tells you the weather , and .\nC : but you have no interaction back with it , .\nC : like the internet you can send emails and you've no interaction .\nD : i'm not with it , because wasn't but it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour .\nD : and has high relevance of six point five .\nD : so it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control .\nD : zero point zero one times an hour .\nD : relevance of three .\nC : probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ?\nD : changing the channels ?\nC : tuning them in at the very start .\nC : if you get new t_v_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you do you think ?\nB : to get the reception and picture , suppose .\nD : so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant .\nD : biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed .\nD : remote controls are often lost somewhere .\nD : so that was already discussed by poppy .\nD : how we could have , an alarm system so that people can find it .\nD : takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control .\nD : so it should be very user-friendly , .\nD : people to do very quickly .\nD : remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .\nB : repetitive strain injury .\nD : is that what it is ?\nD : people with arthritis and such ?\nA : that's rather sad .\nD : our designers can look into that .\nB : i'm guessing that's what it is .\nD : buttons that don't require , , very firm pushing , if they respond .\nD : but we'll have to also avoid , , buttons responding to the slightest touch as .\nD : did you get that one down ?\nD : here's some ideas for you .\nD : large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls .\nD : so i'll show you some numbers here .\nD : so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five .\nD : ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control .\nD : and you can see that number decreases bit with ol interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount .\nD : that would , are willing to pay extra .\nD : so we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into .\nD : and if we have the budget for it .\nD : if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off .\nD : seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .\nA : agree with if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into .\nA : financially and and functionally .\nA : and especially if we are trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that .\nA : ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned .\nD : so that , that's whole other field of research .\nD : if it'd be , if we'd still have remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel .\nD : and depending on how many members you have in households .\nD : so it it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .\nA : and something that might further complicate it is that the t_v_ makes noise itself .\nA : wonder if it would have .\nB : and if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific design .\nA : if we're looking for simplistic design , if we need to decide if that is our intention is , is simplistic design .\nA : because if , if it is then voice , voice-activated , and that would negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using , they won't be talking into remote , i'm .\nD : it looks like .\nD : it'd be like the ultimate remote .\nD : and the last thing here was , an screen .\nD : so , voice recognition might be little too extreme for us .\nD : an screen though might be something that , , you can shift through pages li the way this powerpoint is working .\nD : so that you don't have so many buttons to deal with .\nA : what an screen is .\nD : just , just screen , like computer screen .\nD : or like an alarm clock .\nD : you'd have an versus just , normal clock .\nB : what , what would appear on the screen ?\nA : have no idea still .\nD : just like an electronic screen .\nD : as opposed to just buttons .\nD : there would be like little , like on .\nA : on the remote .\nD : like on the top of cellphone , the the little screen .\nD : now that's , , exactly what exactly we'd put on there .\nD : the channel that you're on , the the volume setting .\nC : could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next .\nC : but that would probably be .\nB : like linked in with the teletext , or like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .\nC : that would be good , .\nC : might be quite expensive to do that though .\nD : that's something we can all take back to our respective research .\nD : and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts .\nD : our priority really should be unique design .\nD : we want something that people want in their home .\nD : every remote control looks the same , so in my opinion it should be , , user-friendly and unique .\nD : so the other might be little too , little too gadgety for some people .\nD : myself , voice recognition scares me off .\nD : so if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product , and for all , the other thing is like age market .\nD : if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy .\nD : but if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should stick to the basics .\nC : and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on remote control .\nC : like their priorities might not be fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , .\nD : and we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research .\nD : , sixteen year old boy would say , i'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance .\nD : so , the older generations we should be catering to bit more .\nC : early twenties , that's the age group .\nA : and if one of the largest , , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use remote control , i'm that something like an screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .\nB : complicated jus complicating things even fo .\nD : that's it for the market research .\nA : before we go into more discussion on we want this design to look like , i've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions .\nA : for one thing , because having controls with d_v_d_ , v_c_r_ , that thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control .\nA : we've decided not to include them and make it specific , just specific television function .\nA : which is good as , as we've decided that we would like to go with that anyway .\nA : for many reasons .\nA : so we have that decision made for us .\nA : another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now .\nA : and so we won't concern ourselves with navigating the teletext option .\nB : would you like to plug in your have you got powerpoint or not ?\nD : we can do the there you go .\nA : i'm looking at looking at it now .\nD : come back screen .\nB : were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?\nA : , we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but they were just saying that the teletext would not be used .\nA : alright , and another thing .\nA : this is for the design , the design of the product is that we wanna create , more of sense that people know that this is from our company .\nA : so , , all the remote controls must have our we'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way .\nA : so , , perhaps our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good .\nA : it doesn't have to be the colour of our of our company but , another thing is that , we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon .\nA : i'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting , wasn't offered , like type of logo or colour , so if that could be somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .\nB : work on that .\nD : it's probably r_r_ in yellow .\nA : the little yellow thing ?\nA : yes , those are the changes .\nA : so , now we need to discuss , and come to decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be .\nA : i'm just going to look at my notes for second .\nA : we have to decide on target group and the functions of the remote control .\nA : so , , we already know that it'll just be for the television .\nA : it'll it won't have teletext .\nA : but , , we could discuss those other options that you brought up , genevieve .\nD : so are we going to write off the option ?\nA : is that how most people feel about that ?\nD : so no , no teletext , and no voice recognition .\nC : it would be annoying though if don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your t_v_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if you'd .\nA : but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , , know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous .\nC : so is it just .\nD : never heard of it .\nA : about other countries besides the u_k_ .\nA : do if anywhere else has it ?\nB : more research required , .\nB : but if was it management decision that we're having .\nA : it was management decision , so it's , it's out of our hands at this point .\nA : so , we're looking at something rather simple .\nD : , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons .\nD : and the what was the word they used ?\nD : findability is important .\nA : we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had .\nA : 'cause i'm that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same infrared the same signal through that and it could just like make little beeping noise .\nB : the same signalling .\nB : or vibrate just the same as mobile phone .\nA : it's not that expensive to do .\nB : like you just , buzz .\nA : like that idea .\nC : would you be able to , , put the little device anywhere ?\nC : 'cause isn't our remote control for all t_v_s , so you'd ha , with the button that you pressed .\nB : if do you mean the the link between the , if the button was actually on , .\nC : 'cause then it would only be applicable to one t_v_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , .\nA : minor detail there .\nB : something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be not very obtrusive .\nA : it would have .\nB : something small that's , that's good point .\nA : then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote control , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller .\nC : would it need battery then ?\nB : unless it could be .\nA : that's your department you'll have to sort that out .\nB : unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the t_v_'s supplied from .\nB : the power for the t_v_ .\nB : so , , more research into that one .\nA : you'll have to , you'll have to investi do some research on that , alright ?\nA : alright , and i'm that , , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , is go ahead .\nA : is everyone interested in that ?\nD : on the buttons ?\nC : like the light up suggestion .\nC : that would be better .\nC : 'cause the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so would go for just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ?\nD : it doesn't it could it could be tactile thing as .\nD : if if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger .\nD : and there's something on it .\nD : like up arrow down arrow for , for volume .\nB : like raised that's true .\nD : and what we could do for , for channels .\nD : the numbers themselves .\nD : but then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .\nC : could be raised .\nC : just little arrows , that you could feel , ?\nD : thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is light up .\nB : and also , heather you mentioned before , like how it should be accessible to everybody .\nB : so like big buttons , for people you are visually impaired .\nB : the glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway .\nB : so like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody .\nC : that , that's good , .\nA : could we somehow we could , may , possibly , , incorporate them both so that the buttons could be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material .\nA : 'cause don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , , like the actual soft plastic , , costs that much more than other colours .\nC : no , wouldn't say so .\nB : no , it's not these days .\nB : it's quite easily accessible .\nD : the other option , referring to the battery thing is , how cellphones will light up for fifteen seconds , when you're and then it goes , so if , if you're like changing the volume during movie .\nC : that's good that good idea .\nD : know , i'm thinking of mostly when you're watching movie you turn all the lights off .\nD : and you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby .\nD : so if you touch the button , it reactivates it .\nD : it lights up for on self timer .\nC : that , , that's good idea .\nB : so self-timed lighting .\nA : alright we have five minutes left , for the meeting , but we should discuss this light subject little bit more before we close .\nA : what was missed the last moment , reading that .\nA : what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?\nD : just if it was kinda the same way that cell how cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch button , after having not touched it for while .\nD : if instead of constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .\nA : so it could be any button that would be pressed .\nD : and you , you touch it and it just lights up bit , and it gives faint glow .\nB : so , self-timed .\nD : so if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it .\nD : because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds .\nA : so that's probably feasible .\nA : so , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ?\nA : do we have to decide what we're gonna do with this .\nB : the shape of the numbers is really good idea .\nB : and that's un unique as .\nC : for visually impaired , .\nB : haven't seen that .\nB : and as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just like painted on , printed .\nA : and it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , , , , better for people with els no what's it called , r_s_i_ , what was it that we were talking about ?\nB : repetitive strain injury .\nA : instead of like hard buttons .\nA : did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ?\nA : or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?\nC : if was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the real reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .\nA : like should we do both ?\nA : or we can have one or the other ?\nA : because it might , for , for our design purposes , , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has funny kinda colour .\nD : was gonna say , exactly .\nA : and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .\nD : it the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark .\nD : it's like eighties neon-style .\nB : and we could there are now like loads , or huge range of different colours that it could light up in as , which could like link in with the company colours .\nD : whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable .\nB : like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so .\nA : so we've decided on lighting up things .\nB : every time the , that it lit up , you that could light up as .\nB : or , or the , whate .\nA : but with the same thing , .\nA : if you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as .\nA : is are you with that ?\nA : so that that completes most of our our more practical decisions .\nA : and now it's up to designing .\nA : and making that this can be feasible .\nA : and do you have anything do you have anything to say ?\nD : was just gonna throw out there the thought about personalising the remote control .\nD : it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates .\nD : so if there's something that diff , like five different face plates .\nD : if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote .\nB : like you can have changeable mobile covers .\nD : exactly , like an ipod .\nA : like an ipod ?\nC : that would be good .\nD : or , or like mobile ph .\nD : and if we'd want to go with like t_v_ show themes .\nD : like bart simpson faceplate .\nC : and then that would be more profitable like as sideline to the remote as .\nC : could buy extra .\nD : you could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .\nC : that's good idea .\nA : that we should incorporate that .\nA : 'cause that wouldn't be very expensive .\nA : you'd just get one mould , throw some plastic in it , .\nB : interchan and also possible , , we could gain out of that by advertising certain t_v_ shows , or .\nA : that might be com problematic with copyright issues .\nA : so , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out .\nB : but if we , there is .\nB : we could , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .\nA : we'll have to do more research .\nA : like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , , the way it'll look .\nA : does it need to be reached de do we need to reach decision on that now ?\nA : because we need to investigate the financial implications .\nB : let's we could probably leave that 'til later on , then .\nA : is it does it need to be decided on now ?\nA : or should we .\nA : anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?\nA : let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later ."], ["<t> The project

and running .\nA : on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design .\nA : and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing .\nA : the meeting will be forty minutes long .\nA : and we will once again have poppy as our first presenter .\nA : alright , and will switch up powerpoint .\nB : should be just loading .\nB : although 't see it on my screen .\nB : that says go here .\nB : i've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , what's available to us to actually make the remote control .\nB : first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field .\nB : thes main internal feature is circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .\nB : which is not necessarily battery , as we're about to see .\nB : there are several components of , , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of .\nB : including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip .\nB : which is where all the main information is contained .\nB : diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as .\nB : and all their positioning in the circuit .\nA : are they all included , like mandatorily , or are these different options ?\nB : these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy simple , regular , advanced .\nB : we can go into that later .\nB : all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective circuit , including all the wires and everything like that .\nB : and the l_e_d_ , that's light emitting diode .\nB : so , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as .\nB : there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source .\nB : we could use basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as .\nB : and they're not so to dispose of , environmentally .\nB : there's hand-powered dynamo which is thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .\nB : bit out of date .\nB : kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .\nA : what is hand-powered dynamo ?\nB : where you manually charge up the power .\nB : like you wind up something .\nA : just every , every once in while ?\nA : just every once in while or constantly ?\nB : every once in while .\nA : it'd be strange to always be cranking it .\nB : it would be like going step back in time .\nB : don't would really be with cutting edge technology .\nB : whereas kinetic energy is new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power .\nB : the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work .\nB : or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .\nB : but , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way .\nB : lots of considerations for the case , like what shape it would be , curved or flat .\nB : that's got lot to do with the ergonomics .\nB : like how it's comfortable and sits in the hand .\nB : we don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up .\nB : or too small .\nB : or too slidy .\nB : 've had remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that i'd be pressing like volume button instead of the on button .\nB : because you can't really see which way round it is .\nB : we also can choose what materials , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more ideal for the anti-r_s_i_ .\nB : it's like the same rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands .\nB : again , stepping back in time again there .\nB : don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here .\nB : titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really .\nB : but , would've been for future projects .\nB : our choice for buttons as .\nB : we've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some new multiple option scroll buttons .\nB : that was brought up for , , they're quite flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons .\nB : you can just slide up and down .\nB : i'm we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .\nA : one thing with the scroll buttons though .\nA : it , it we would have to have an display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .\nB : and that would lead to an advanced .\nB : if we have .\nB : we're going on to that later with the advanc with the that means we'd need really advanced chip .\nB : and it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget .\nB : also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with .\nB : it's the most straightforward .\nB : but you can in like incorporate that with scroll button as .\nB : got decisions to make there .\nB : and this is what was just saying before .\nB : linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs .\nB : simple would go with the pushbutton .\nB : regular you could link with the scroll button .\nB : and the advanced we'd have to go with display .\nB : my personal preferences ?\nB : we could go for the kinetic energy source .\nB : don't , that's quite an advanced technology .\nB : it's not been seen before , so it could be quite , novelty factor , attractive as .\nB : and also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external battery supply or solar panels .\nB : you just give it shake .\nB : sounds brilliant to me .\nB : rubber casing thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-r_s_i_ and like more choice with aesthetics .\nB : like it could be any colour we want .\nB : and gives you , , more flexibility there .\nB : and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .\nA : one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior .\nA : this is the one thing that's protecting its innards .\nB : that would , there would be an in more internal casing .\nB : and the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human .\nA : another thing is it might be more difficult if it's rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates .\nA : is it don't see how like rubber plate going on top it would stay there .\nA : like if it was like clip-on plastic plate .\nA : it would work that way .\nB : if the , , if it was just , more of rubber coating which was on to case .\nC : like plastic with rubber , on top , there's , there is certain phone that has like rubber casing , like nokia it is .\nB : so , it was , the whole thing would be removable .\nB : like 't think of what .\nB : or like an you can get outer casing for ipods and something , that's just it's protective as .\nD : like the skin ?\nB : it , it stops it , , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped , as , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily .\nB : mixture of both there , .\nD : so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .\nD : and the buttons are rubber .\nA : that sounds good .\nA : , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?\nB : as far as know .\nB : it should be .\nA : we'll just say .\nA : yes , just why not .\nA : like the kinetic energy source idea .\nA : when people will , , be moving remote around lot .\nA : but that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic energy source .\nA : it could make an we could have any style .\nA : it wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and .\nA : just for environmental reasons .\nD : it's bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before .\nD : so it seems we'd have to do more research on it .\nD : or if you could have battery pack .\nB : like as backup .\nD : so there's there is one battery , because most remotes use two batteries believe .\nD : so , if it was running off of one battery as .\nC : that would be good .\nB : some alternative just in case something went wrong .\nC : we could you were saying about solar power ma not working indoors , but lot of calculators , , have solar power .\nB : thought of that .\nC : so that could be incorporated as .\nB : may that could be the backup .\nB : instead of battery .\nD : although it needs some light , doesn't it ?\nB : like solar backup .\nC : do , do those calculators .\nB : suppose but some but thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time .\nA : you can watch t_v_ in the dark then .\nD : so , if we're doing .\nC : how it works .\nB : it can be stored .\nB : it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it .\nB : it just needs to be in light for certain amount of time per day .\nB : like few hours day .\nA : that might be little impractical though .\nD : sometimes it's just shoved under , under cushion , and .\nB : it could easily .\nA : like people don't wanna have to worry about that .\nB : suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , no , forgot to charge my remote today .\nB : like if the kinetic thing , what's best about that is that it's instant energy .\nB : you don't have to , , you can shake it few times , or whatever .\nB : and it works .\nA : or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .\nB : instead of you don't have to like make it's in the place to charge and .\nA : 's that the end of your presentation .\nB : there we go .\nC : it's not on my screen .\nB : it wasn't on mine either .\nB : , used the mouse on there .\nC : is it that one ?\nC : i'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now .\nC : first of all i'll explain what user interface is .\nC : it's the aspects of computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , , heard or felt , or by the human user .\nC : and it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data .\nC : there are two types of user interfaces .\nC : there's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and pointing device , mouse for input control .\nC : so that's like the scroll thing we were talking about .\nC : i'm not really about the pictures that that's on an screen .\nC : or it's the the buttons or pictures .\nC : do you t's .\nB : so suppose sometime after you .\nA : because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at keyboard , so the numbers are like keyboard .\nA : you're pressing the numbers for , , for what you want .\nC : so you must , for the graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics .\nC : like an screen .\nB : suppose where on some buttons you would have like the power would be some symbol .\nB : and if you wanted to go onto teletext or , know we're not having that , but similar thing , you , they have there's like little picture with screen with lines across it , which suppose it's that thing like the , the symbol on the button .\nB : but if we're having simplified display anyway , that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that .\nA : we'll be doing .\nB : it'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .\nA : it'd be more command interface , and then .\nB : suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and like that .\nD : so it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?\nD : the infrared is like , that's considered .\nC : no it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per could be wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .\nD : so when it says pointing device that doesn't include .\nA : they're talking about type things .\nC : but we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic .\nC : but the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user points , as in just to make it nicer to look at .\nA : what do you mean ?\nC : like 't think of an example , but like little pictures rather than like little sound .\nA : like how the buttons , as button though .\nC : instead of saying volume , like little speaker .\nA : so , it's keyboard in the shape of it , ?\nA : like that idea .\nC : the co we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for remote control .\nC : as it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly .\nC : the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , , target the design area of the interface .\nC : make it more trendy and original .\nC : we'll have more money if we keep it simple .\nA : i'm like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget .\nA : bit more too , .\nC : seeing as it's quite new technology .\nC : we , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , , more user-friendly remote control , that lot of interfaces consist of clutter of buttons , that , , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .\nB : that's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things .\nB : it can be bit , , overwhelming .\nC : and interfaces are different .\nC : so , , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand .\nC : and learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .\nC : does anyone have any questions ?\nA : do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it simplistic look .\nD : if we go with the design plate thing , we'll have to .\nD : just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .\nA : but what about the lighting up effect ?\nD : you mean different colours for the lighting or .\nA : , , we had decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up .\nA : and so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up .\nD : see what you're saying .\nD : so you're picturing the light is coming from the back .\nA : if they were white they would glow , probably .\nA : if they were made out of rubber .\nD : kinda pictured it as coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .\nD : but , but , you mean from the back .\nA : where would the light come from ?\nB : i'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .\nB : so there would have to , have to be some parts transparent around the buttons , .\nA : and rubber is more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of .\nB : it should be able to .\nC : in the phone that was thinking of as , when you change the covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , , that contro control , are behind the rubber .\nC : so you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces .\nC : 'cause it's just the wee control , , thing that's behind it .\nD : they , they insert over .\nC : so , we don't have to decide on one colour .\nC : each face could have its own colour of buttons ?\nA : if they're raised up buttons .\nA : so that you can feel them .\nA : we were talking about it being more , lot more tangible .\nD : is that my turn then ?\nA : it might be more difficult to do .\nA : if they're , if they're sticking up .\nA : if it's flat then , like like on cellphone or mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to press down on these tiny little buttons , but .\nB : it would be possible .\nB : don't would make that much difference .\nB : the the dimensions of it .\nB : 'cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of mobile phone .\nB : you can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons .\nB : and then you get to the circuit .\nB : don't would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing .\nB : i'm you could work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty .\nB : i'm that'd be fine .\nA : if it's do-able we can do .\nA : sounds good to me .\nC : so that's everything , then ?\nA : that means you're up .\nD : have shorter report for you today .\nD : it took while to get this , .\nB : you're not plugged in yet .\nD : that's very good point .\nD : so , this report is about trend-watching .\nD : so we can live up to our , our purpose of having very fashionable remote control .\nD : there we go .\nD : so , just so , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around .\nD : also spoke with fashion experts in milan , new york and paris .\nD : and looked at the design reports from previous years , here at real remote .\nD : just so we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed .\nD : so i'll list the three most important aspects that i've come across .\nD : and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it .\nD : the first one is that there should be fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel .\nD : this should be our priority , as we've been saying .\nD : the second most important aspect is that remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative .\nD : so , we've done lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates .\nD : so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that .\nD : and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use .\nD : so , pretty basic there .\nD : and the recent fashion update , , according to fashion-watchers in paris and milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .\nD : also , in contra in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy .\nD : again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons .\nD : so , my personal preferences here , , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and i'd like to stick to that .\nD : the fruits and vegetable themes , if that's going to work for us .\nD : it sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware .\nD : if we wanna do it on remotes .\nD : it could be one of the options .\nD : for the television that people have in their kitchen .\nD : the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that .\nD : and then , , tying in trendy look with user-friendliness .\nA : it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that find rather jarring .\nA : everything else we can really , we can really , do , according to our plans already , given the market .\nB : it is strange .\nA : but fruits and vegetables seems very strange idea for remote control .\nD : it's , it's little but it , it's everywhere .\nB : we possibly could take more abstract design .\nD : so we i've seen lot of purses with olives on them , .\nD : but , if we stick to t_v_ based , , t_v_ shows , or or colour schemes .\nA : but they still need to fit into people's decor though .\nB : like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables .\nB : and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes .\nB : we don't have to make something in the shape of strawberry , but it could have the curves of strawberry , .\nD : the the essence of strawberry .\nB : or strawberry seed or leaf .\nB : or just like really make it quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing .\nB : instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's bit .\nB : it doesn't quite fit in with the trendy , it does , if that's the current theme .\nB : but may we could go more directly , .\nB : but initially , .\nB : if we just tone it down bit .\nA : tone it down .\nB : and like not , not .\nA : like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product .\nD : one thing was thinking though is if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals .\nD : so there could be animal-based , .\nD : because lot of people have house cat .\nD : or , or dog .\nD : that might be getting , , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are .\nD : but it's something to keep in mind .\nD : and , did you have any questions ?\nA : alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions .\nA : so i'll need to hook up the powerpoint again .\nD : there you go .\nD : have you been saving your powerpoint presentations to the .\nB : didn't for the first one .\nB : but have now .\nA : but it's still around ?\nC : where do you have to save it to ?\nA : i'm just trying to make this pop up now .\nA : here we go .\nA : so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do .\nA : so energy , we .\nA : no 't write it in when it's in this setting .\nA : does anyone know how to take it out of , .\nA : so back to decisions .\nA : energy , we've decided on kinetic , ?\nA : so that's good .\nB : are we going to have backup ?\nB : or do we just we could just go for the kinetic energy , and be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and hope that it works .\nA : but would backup really be necessary ?\nA : will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , if there is backup .\nA : there's like no reason why it wouldn't work , ?\nD : so so if it's not working they just have to shake it bit and that revitalises it ?\nB : we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential .\nA : it could even be one of our selling points .\nB : go for it .\nB : it could be fully kinetic energy .\nB : is everyone happy with that ?\nA : alright , the next decision is chip on print .\nA : don't exactly that means .\nB : it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip .\nB : and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so , it was so that was without the .\nA : and we were going for more simplistic style , ?\nB : so that means we're not doing the advanced .\nB : so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .\nA : we decided on the pushbuttons , ?\nB : so that's the simple .\nA : would we need more advanced one for the lighting , the interior lighting system ?\nB : so , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need .\nB : so it's medium .\nB : so regular chip .\nA : that's called medium , or regular ?\nD : is regular not simple ?\nB : if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as .\nC : it's for the lighting , .\nA : does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ?\nB : so this is just like gonna be the very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .\nA : plastic and coated in rubber .\nA : plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable , interchangeable plates .\nB : plastic rubber coat .\nB : still going for that .\nA : user interface concept .\nA : this is your time to shine .\nC : we decided on the component .\nC : i'm , i've lost my powerpoint thing , so 't remember what it's ca it's the component the command inter the command line interface .\nD : was called command interface .\nB : was it ouch .\nD : command interface , .\nA : did you say command line ?\nA : alright , and supplements .\nC : that is haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use .\nC : like what what are ideas to combat these problems ?\nC : how different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .\nC : we haven't really decided what to do about that .\nA : what are our choices here ?\nC : t's just where where shall we locate the buttons .\nC : what functions wi shall we have ?\nA : you mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?\nC : so pretty just just the basic button functions .\nA : like if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have , .\nB : tone , contrast , and things .\nB : that's bit , it was minima , it wasn't the .\nD : that was on , one of my presentations .\nD : about how often it was used .\nD : do you remember that ?\nA : it was hardly ever used really .\nD : should bring it up ?\nB : that would be good .\nA : and most televisions will come with remote .\nB : and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , so .\nA : know we want numbers .\nD : the ch screen settings was used zero point five times an hour .\nD : so tw twice every once every two hours .\nD : and it was considered one point five relevance , on scale of ten .\nD : that's brightness , colour , tone , all that .\nC : you don't change that often , .\nB : most of that comes like on the individual television set itself , doesn't it ?\nB : i'm it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote .\nA : and different televisions .\nA : like we , if we can make remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that .\nB : so we're just going for power , channels , volume , .\nD : the other one was audio settings .\nD : mono , stereo , pitch .\nD : sometimes use that .\nD : some t_v_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high .\nD : like almost once an hour .\nD : relevance of two .\nA : we have five minutes to finish our meeting .\nA : , let's do this fast .\nA : should we have audio ?\nD : that didn't some up on mine .\nA : it only comes up on mine usually .\nC : it it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though .\nA : don't , it's , it's problem with the international appeal , .\nA : if we have audio because we how other televisions work .\nA : but we know that everyone has this and it's the same .\nD : that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , it is good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons .\nB : i've , that's it .\nD : this one has channel , volume and your channe and your power .\nC : that could be sales pitch .\nB : we can just go for , make it selling point that it is just the basic .\nA : and , , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes .\nA : we'll be meeting again in thirty minutes .\nA : you'll be working , poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design .\nA : and the user interface design , so this is where the trendy comes in .\nA : and you'll be evaluating the product .\nA : poppy and tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .\nA : and , , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .\nA : so , anyone else have something to say ?\nB : have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect .\nB : are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , thi we should keep to that rather than moving to animals , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , that we should probably go along with that .\nB : so suppose that'll come out in our dev design development .\nB : but you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ?\nD : now do you need want an idea of how many are you gonna come up with casing ideas ?\nD : like five different .\nC : what what was thinking what do yous think of this ?\nC : having the numbers like , not bunch of grapes , but like purple and in triangle .\nD : you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .\nC : like that's fruity .\nB : we can have look at those ideas , .\nD : what you ideally you'd think of age markets as .\nD : so it's something that will , , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds .\nD : something that your granny would want on her remote control .\nD : and international tastes as , so not easy .\nB : lot of things to consider .\nA

prototype presentation by our two designers .\nA : and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it .\nA : and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget .\nA : have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options .\nA : and evaluate the product , as group .\nA : and so first we'll have the prototype presentation .\nA : do you need the powerpoint for this ?\nB : got few slides , so show them .\nB : do you want to present it ?\nC : this is what we came up with .\nB : here we are .\nC : it's pretty simple design .\nC : it's based on mango ?\nC : and we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind .\nD : what was the where's the l_e_d_ ?\nC : it's in the middle of one of the little r_s .\nC : and then the other one is the power .\nC : and we just have simple design .\nC : we wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb .\nB : so it's palm-held .\nA : notice you have number ten button .\nC : so you don't have to that was mistake , wasn't it ?\nC : no , that's zero .\nB : you just need the nought .\nC : take that one off .\nC : was in charge of the numbers .\nC : and this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus .\nB : so one plus one would be eleven , or because if you on your average remote , if you press one twice you just go to or say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve .\nC : you can go one , three .\nC : you press that first and then you go one three .\nA : you press plus button ?\nA : i've never heard of that kind before .\nC : just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and so the plus and then .\nB : so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .\nA : but would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?\nC : no no , all that's why we have all these numbers .\nC : these numbers these numbers all work independently up to nine .\nA : but if you press , it'll go to that channel away .\nA : 'cause you gotta press the plus afterwards .\nC : the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine .\nA : know , but if if wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if press the six it'll go to channel six , and then i'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?\nC : no you press the plus first .\nC : doesn't we haven't really would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you simpler ?\nB : don't mind , we can further define that .\nA : it wouldn't be problem .\nB : wouldn't have thought it'd be problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .\nA : but was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .\nB : but suppose it's not as snappy .\nD : the there is there's delay on remotes .\nD : where you can have it it's like five second input time .\nB : if you don't put it .\nD : so as long as you hit them dada it should be fine .\nD : as long as there's not big pause between the hitting the two buttons .\nB : and channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like it's the bigger .\nD : was there so on the top there is volume and channel up volume up .\nA : c_ and v_ .\nC : just so we can flick it's in the middle of one of the little r_s .\nA : where where's the power button ?\nB : so it's just like .\nC : so it's all accessible .\nB : we deci we went for like circular design for the numbers because we thought that's more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .\nC : without taking your hand off the remote .\nB : ergonomics are all considered .\nC : and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as .\nA : ergonomic , definitely ergonomic .\nB : it could another type of repetitive stress injury though .\nB : but , no it's different movement so .\nB : and the feel of it , , we've made this out of play doh , which is representing the , , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .\nB : 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-r_s_i_ material is often used in stress balls so this has got bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different .\nA : bit of stress ball feel .\nB : would you like to feel it yourselves ?\nB : how it fits in the palm of your hand ?\nA : there you go .\nD : killed the five .\nD : killed the four .\nB : as for the colours , we were presented with limited range of colours for this prototype .\nD : it smells good .\nC : of play doh .\nB : but we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use .\nB : or the combination .\nB : and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all bit garish .\nC : 'cause it'd be quite subtle and .\nA : it looks more think like vanilla and banana would .\nB : banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black .\nB : so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength .\nB : watermelon , , probably appealing to the , seasonal .\nA : kinda christmas , .\nB : apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , , khaki .\nC : the pomegranate's kinda girly and funky , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor .\nB : we thought of the components it was definitely focus of ergonomics and just single ha handheld device , you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .\nB : as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-r_s_i_ and that's about it .\nA : alright , very much .\nA : good work everyone .\nD : bravo you want the what order it goes in .\nA : and so now that we've we have prototype , we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches what our budget can handle .\nA : so , have something i'm going to minute .\nA : do you need to do presentation first ?\nA : i'm gonna check that out for second .\nA : what time is it anyw you're .\nA : evaluation criteria is next in line .\nD : there we go .\nD : come on my computer .\nD : my computer's giving me technical difficulties .\nA : just press function eight again .\nD : should press it again ?\nD : last time did that it sh .\nA : and then again .\nA : one more time .\nD : still not there .\nD : now for this one could would you prefer use the whiteboard or mayb i'll just do it on on the screen where you can see it .\nD : we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen .\nD : and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , made list of what our original requirements and goals were , , back to our kick-off meeting this morning .\nD : and we'll evaluate as to whether we've done what we set out to do .\nD : and we're gonna do it on one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false .\nD : so the lower the lower the points the better .\nD : so question number one .\nD : does the remote whoops .\nD : i'm not gonna be able , i'll do it on the whiteboard .\nD : 't change it so i'm i'm gonna ask you to push it down once .\nD : i'll write down our scores up on the so number one .\nD : do we have fancy look-and-feel ?\nB : we've been quite successful with the rubber coating and .\nA : the look is little bit more playful .\nD : that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different .\nD : it's not your traditional .\nB : the colour has lot to do with it .\nB : the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that we would've necessarily chosen .\nB : it's not the sleek red , black and yellow , and orange .\nA : you were only given red and black ?\nC : so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey .\nB : but if you can imagine that in like just pale metallic-y finish know t's for rubber .\nC : so we want it to be stand out that way , anyway .\nC : metallic-y finish we were thinking .\nB : diff if you can visualise this in colours it would look quite fancy .\nD : kinda like the potato look .\nD : it's very different .\nB : potato , mango , fruit and veg .\nC : we we were we were thinking about .\nD : the mango the mango look .\nD : it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood .\nB : it's really adaptable .\nD : so myself would say one or two .\nA : would say two .\nC : i'd say two .\nD : and one being true .\nB : for the fancy two , three .\nD : actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that .\nD : so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ?\nD : so know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .\nB : and the use of the rubber .\nD : use of the rubber , the use of the l_e_d_ .\nB : for the anti-r_s_i_ .\nB : the l_e_d_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's probably halfway .\nB : in some aspects it is , like we said .\nA : i'd say three .\nC : i'll go for three as .\nD : and it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose .\nA : we want it simple .\nB : though it was our specification .\nC : wouldn't be simple , .\nD : so we'll put three , but we actually reached our goal .\nD : we didn't want it any more than that .\nD : question number three .\nD : will it be easy to use ?\nC : one for that .\nD : it's you can't really get confused with that .\nD : there'll be we have to work out the number the plus system .\nA : the plus number thing .\nC : that's the only thing .\nD : but once that's figured out , it should be fine .\nB : and perhaps the turning on but .\nD : is this good-looking remote ?\nD : remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .\nB : again the colour comes into this .\nA : colour will definitely be factor .\nA : that the logo could be smaller .\nA : and not such prominent way .\nC : but the remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .\nA : like at the bottom , .\nB : not in don't worry .\nA : it just had to be on there .\nD : should just not touch it .\nD : this time it's the three killed .\nD : was just wondering if it should be like flatter .\nD : or the bottom could be like ch chopped bit .\nB : suppose i've got quite big hands .\nA : like the appeal of it being like big glob in your hand .\nC : but what i've just thought of there now .\nC : what where's it gonna sit in your living room ?\nC : is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ?\nA : if the bottom was just flat , and then the rest is like round .\nC : but then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand .\nA : it would still be comfortable .\nB : thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly .\nA : we we could handle it .\nD : it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up .\nC : that would be .\nA : it'd fall over all the time though .\nA : it'd be annoying .\nB : it's less , what's ha .\nD : if it's weighted .\nB : it's got higher centre of gravity like that .\nD : details , details .\nA : we're done designing .\nD : so , is this good-looking remote ?\nD : would we wanna show it off to our friends ?\nC : you would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes .\nA : it was another colour and it was like it'd look .\nD : gue , it's personal taste , but .\nB : would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , i'm not happy with those colours .\nD : so should we say two for that ?\nD : question number five .\nD : what's will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product ?\nD : remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when remote control looked fancy .\nC : we have to market it in the way , that to say that it is simplistic .\nC : so people don't just see it and think , , this is so simplistic , don't want to spend twenty five euros .\nC : we have to market it .\nD : it the marketing will have lot to do with it .\nB : and the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , no .\nC : and the kinetic energy part .\nD : shake it and the buttons fall off .\nC : don't shake no the plus .\nB : but , those'll be firmly on .\nC : you're use the zero .\nD : no , , much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but am , aren't ?\nC : make new one .\nA : but you're our marketing expert .\nC : they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ?\nC : about ten pounds .\nD : but you don't have to buy batteries .\nD : so in the long term this can actually save you money .\nB : , that's true .\nD : so we'll market it that way too .\nD : so with good marketing scheme and the personalisation options , it'll .\nA : would give it two still though .\nD : can someone read it out ?\nB : does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .\nD : so that was mainly that the statistics we said .\nC : it does very .\nB : because , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing .\nB : and it's just you won't have to think about it .\nB : you don't have to look down to find them .\nB : they're clearly there , easy to use .\nD : the the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the video input and sound and .\nD : but they're not you and really .\nD : heather could you push it down ?\nD : will this remote control be easy to find when lost ?\nD : remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly .\nD : now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ?\nA : we have the alarm system .\nC : the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra it'll be again in the marketing .\nB : it lights on and , or flash as .\nB : but it's not obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't particularly see an alarm .\nA : the light from the inside was gonna light up .\nC : the light it will .\nA : or or was it gonna make noise ?\nC : but but both .\nB : but when the alarm's not .\nA : you press the button it makes noise ?\nD : it turns into duck and starts quacking .\nC : that would be brilliant .\nC : i'd be tempted to .\nB : the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , , when it when it lights up as we it could light up when the alarm went .\nB : but if it was hidden underneath the cushion , there wouldn't be any point .\nB : so you can't see the alarm , but it would light up .\nC : it would have to be in the market but you still couldn't see it .\nA : though it was gonna make noise .\nB : alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside the alarm system itself .\nC : it would just be little speaker on the back .\nD : we you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype .\nD : but , it'll be there .\nD : so we can we could say that we can give it one , because compared to every other remote ever ever made , this one will be easier to find .\nD : question number eight .\nB : that wasn't very clear .\nA : no problem , .\nD : will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ?\nD : remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult .\nD : so it has to be , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll to do .\nC : so the plu the plus once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , won't it ?\nD : the plus thing needs to be worked on .\nB : just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , that in itself makes it so much easier to use .\nD : do does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ?\nD : so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .\nA : so it's just like channel six , six , enter .\nC : that annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press why .\nA : but you don't have to press zeros .\nD : you could just press six enter , or one two enter .\nB : and or sixty six enter , that's probably more straightforward .\nA : and then like twelve , enter .\nC : alright , aye .\nD : so we can we'll say yes it's one ?\nC : i'd say one .\nD : question number nine .\nD : will it minimise the effects of r_s_i_ , which was repeated strain injury ?\nD : which affected over quarter of users .\nD : it's soft , and and people could .\nA : it's like in the your thumb might get little bit .\nC : but if you're zapping .\nB : that's what was thinking .\nC : don't will , the biology .\nB : we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we about .\nA : but it is soft .\nA : and that's what the the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r_s_i_ , so it is but .\nD : what other options there are .\nB : we're getting that's true .\nD : could , you could hold it in your left hand and use your index finger .\nD : but there's not really any other options unless it's like keyboard .\nD : so , we did as as much as you can with remote control .\nD : so , one or two do you think ?\nC : i'd say two .\nD : did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ?\nA : yes we did .\nD : now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ?\nD : is the yellow .\nC : we we can't really do that because on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow .\nC : it won't stand out .\nC : so it's not always gonna be the same colour .\nD : it sounds like the colour's something that we but the yell yellow's ugly though , depending on the so we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the r_r_ .\nA : the colours are yellow and grey .\nA : so it could be grey on the banana one .\nC : could be grey .\nC : we didn't even rea .\nB : this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .\nC : perhaps metallic or or like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have little bit of metal .\nC : that isn't rubber .\nD : and the buttons in the middle .\nD : so , do you think that's more of three then ?\nD : three , four ?\nB : don't what do what .\nD : have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put four ?\nD : and final question .\nD : did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ?\nD : current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess .\nA : would say so .\nC : following that briefing we did .\nA : but more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just naming it by fruit .\nA : with the with the colours .\nB : like the colour scheme names and .\nD : no , , are the plates interchangeable ?\nD : missed few they are ?\nD : so you can have banana and kiwi and .\nD : so that's something that's in the making too , like it'll become more .\nA : that's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates .\nC : that was our brief and we followed the brief .\nC : haven't got big banana but .\nB : the thing is , if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , if you'd instantly say mango .\nA : if it was scented .\nC : that would be class .\nB : there we go .\nB : that would be .\nA : we have money for that .\nA : alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?\nD : yes we do .\nD : so wh what was gonna put for that ?\nD : two for fashion ?\nA : would say two .\nD : so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven is between .\nA : one point nine ?\nB : it's between one and two .\nA : between one and two .\nB : so that's pretty fantastic .\nC : close to two .\nD : that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one .\nC : got , 'cause we've four to bring down .\nD : does that seem then ?\nB : it seems like it should be more around two .\nC : should've added five .\nB : do we have an online calculator ?\nA : i'm attempting to do that now .\nA : it is one point nine .\nA : go heather pauls .\nA : alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget .\nA : and my computer's frozen .\nA : and now it's not .\nA : so in our shared folder , if everyone could go there now , i'm going to steal cable .\nD : are you gonna do that ?\nA : it's it's it's an excel file .\nC : is that the project document ?\nA : there we go .\nA : and have to access that as .\nB : it says it it just means that we can't add any more to it now .\nA : so far i've added what or what is going on ?\nA : it's blinking at me .\nA : it's locked for editing .\nA : i'm gonna open up second one then 'cause it's locked for editing .\nA : have the original in my my email account .\nD : is it locked 'cause i'm in it ?\nB : have you have you completed it ?\nA : no , was hoping that you could .\nA : there we go .\nA : here we go .\nA : so we need to tally up how much our our product will be costing .\nA : so if you can look up at the screen , the large screen , looking at your own too and telling me which one you think .\nA : we're using kinetic which is quite large expense at three euros .\nA : we're using regular chip .\nA : it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around .\nA : that's another three .\nA : we're already at five .\nA : we're using plastic and rubber , so good thing plastic is free , we're at eight .\nC : what about special colour ?\nC : are we using that ?\nA : we should do it just for one kind .\nA : so it's like special colour 'll have two colours ?\nA : one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons .\nA : so we can , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive .\nA : and we have special colour for the button , and we also have special form .\nA : and special material .\nC : and special material .\nA : which puts us just barely under budget .\nA : so our operating cost is twelve twenty euros .\nA : and back to our powerpoint .\nA : yes we are .\nA : so we need to do product evaluation , again , which is probably .\nA : different extension of .\nB : of the actual project rather than the product ?\nA : 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork .\nB : so wh how we actually went round about doing it .\nA : alright so do you feel like there was room for creativity ?\nB : we were pushed .\nA : pushed for creativity ?\nB : we weren't really given lot of time , or materials , , to go about our design task .\nC : the ma or materials .\nB : so we could've done with bit more time .\nA : so it'd be like need more time and materials .\nA : but you were allowed creativity ?\nA : so as like but you were supposed to have creativ .\nD : and the conceptual and functional .\nD : like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea , but when we can down to it .\nB : were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that .\nB : so that did limit creativity .\nB : the fruit and veg idea .\nA : is this me being like , do you like me ?\nD : good leadership , we stayed on task .\nB : we've , seeing as we've come out with what we intended .\nB : pro product within the budget .\nB : that's sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way , so it's been fine .\nD : and the timing was good .\nD : we never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so was good teamwork .\nB : and project manager .\nA : we worked as team .\nD : we are well-suited to our roles .\nA : alright how were our means ?\nB : and more play doh , 'cause that was all the red we had .\nA : we needed more play doh colours .\nB : so even if we wanted to make bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to .\nC : it it might've been bigger .\nA : but ever everything else was satisfactory ?\nA : is that good ?\nD : the computer programmes are good .\nB : it could be really straightforward for the computer .\nD : don't think there was anything .\nB : the only thing was having to remember to to tick the okays but was the only one who struggled with that .\nC : i'm actually not if i've saved my presentations .\nD : they'll probably still be there .\nA : new ideas found .\nA : don't really that means .\nD : i'm not , new ideas found .\nB : we've all learnt from each other , like the .\nB : just about each different .\nB : got new ideas from each other .\nD : we really it we bounced off of each other , which was .\nD : like based on marketing and then you'd say something about interface and , worked .\nC : and we were able to modify each other's ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise .\nD : does it have smart materials by the way ?\nD : does it have smart materials ?\nB : did it come into the into if we counted that in the costs .\nC : if if it if it if it can be afforded .\nA : with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide .\nA : yes our costs are within budget .\nA : it's evaluated generally positively .\nA : and don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary .\nA : then we celebrate in such way that have no idea .\nD : by watching t_v_ ?"], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves and describe their roles in the upcoming project.

new fantastic remote .\nA : i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager .\nA : we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is .\nD : am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role .\nD : in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out .\nD : in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web .\nD : and then finally in the detailed design phase will be doing product evaluation and so will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .\nC : hiya , i'm ryan .\nC : i'm the user interface designer .\nC : likewise i've three different roles for each stage of design .\nC : the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of remote control .\nC : in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product .\nC : and the detailed design like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special .\nC : that's about it .\nB : i'm manuel and i'm the industrial designer in in this project .\nB : in the functional design phase i'm i'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on .\nB : suppose we'll work together on that one .\nB : in the conceptual design i'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product .\nB : and the detailed design in the detailed design i'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , so we're working together on the design front here .\nA : so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , acquaintance which we've kinda done .\nA : tool training , project plan discussion and then closing .\nA : grand total of twenty five minutes we have here .\nA : so we are putting together new remote control .\nA : we want it to be something original .\nA : we're not only electronics company but fashion conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy and we want it to be easy to use .\nA : we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design which is is the three of you .\nA : and functional design .\nA : do we have any ideas of of let's just throw out some ideas of what remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .\nC : function of remote control is just just , change channels is its main function .\nA : so we want it to be t_v_ remote or do we want it to to do other things besides just be television remote ?\nC : suppose you try make it universal remote for could work on all electrical products in in one person's house .\nC : but , , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .\nC : they all work on the same prin principle as sorta like don't actually know .\nC : but is it just infra-red ?\nC : is that standard ?\nA : , universal remote .\nA : this is my first go-round with creating remote control , so we're all in the same boat here .\nC : one thing of with the remote control is you always lose .\nC : so if there's way of finding it quite easily , that'd be quite good quite good feature .\nD : ch like tracking device ?\nA : so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has like tracking device or or like it makes noise , there's button on the t_v_ that you press and .\nC : you can get those key you could whistle or make noise and it'd beep .\nC : generally , all remotes are quite similar in their appearance .\nA : do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular .\nA : do we want something crazy ?\nA : we want something new that's gonna stand out .\nD : lot more modern .\nA : modern so our remote should be .\nD : like user-friendly , like little , where you can use both hands , like little keyboard type thing .\nC : people , because people always tend to throw remote control about the place to one another if it was in ball , and the actual controls are inside .\nB : there are certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here .\nB : however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , .\nB : what are we gonna build that thing out of ?\nB : how sturdy is it gonna be ?\nB : do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half year ?\nA : so , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , , if it were ball-shaped , then it .\nC : it could be cased on the outside and everything could be inside .\nA : so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , so our form and our function .\nA : we want it to be easy to find .\nA : what else it what else do we want it to to do ?\nA : so we want it to be universal .\nA : it's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros and , goals for profits are somewhere around fifty million euros , what they wanna make on it , so .\nD : also since we're partners of the international remote control association , we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .\nD : that's more on the research end , but the marketing .\nA : so marketing , , how marketing , you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there .\nD : and as far as design goes , we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting .\nA : do you have any ideas for what it should look like ?\nA : we could draw it up on the on the board over there .\nA : we want it to be ball , , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and where the buttons are located .\nC : i'd could draw sorta the ball idea .\nC : my original idea was just simply sphere , where you this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be flip , like flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it .\nC : if that if we did use hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have just sorta you you , your buttons .\nC : thing is inside , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so as simple as possible , as few buttons inside as possible .\nC : , what's the idea for .\nC : just something if you ha if it had like if some like light or lights around it .\nC : it's looking bit like something out of star wars at the moment though , to be fair .\nC : that was that was sorta simple idea had and then you could about , it would almost be like ball .\nC : so that was just just an idea had .\nC : whether anybody else has other ideas ?\nB : one problem you'd get with this design is the ball is idea because of it's stability really , but , since it's ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part .\nB : that's one of the big issues .\nC : that's that's good idea .\nB : also also you risk the hinges here .\nB : that's that's problem .\nC : the idea it didn't have to necessarily be hinge , that was just one idea though .\nB : that's that's interesting , but that's weak point , .\nA : how would we go about making getting rid of our weak points ?\nA : what would we just have flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?\nA : not to put you on the spot , but what did you say your title was again ?\nB : no no , .\nB : i'm your industrial designer , so , the point is that .\nA : you're the the industrial designer .\nB : the shape is perhaps not the most ideal .\nB : as as stable as it is , there must be compromise between stability and design here , so .\nC : suppose that things become design .\nC : but was trying to think of like the design of others .\nC : 't think of anything other than long rectangle for remote , small , fatter ones , but there's nothing being done out of left field , .\nA : it's not new , it's not innovative , it's , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable .\nD : i'll draw something .\nA : so if no , go ahead .\nD : my idea was just to have it be like keyboard type shape , , like video games so .\nD : but that would be kinda big and bulky .\nD : we could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way .\nD : that's my idea .\nC : definitely doing something different is good idea .\nC : design something , that's like suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would fit in the hand easier .\nA : something with grip .\nA : because even suppose even with the ball it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto .\nC : it still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , .\nA : so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better .\nA : but then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so we feel like i'm just shooting everything down here .\nC : it's definitely got to be one-handed one-handed job .\nD : you're the boss , you're allowed to .\nB : with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size 'cause from cell phones , they can be too small .\nB : so if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be as functional .\nB : so for that there's so the question is also , , do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?\nA : so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it .\nA : we've talked about our experiences with remote control and we've got couple ideas .\nA : let's see here .\nA : what if we had what if we had not only say we went with the ball the ball function , but we give it grips along the side to make it easier to hold on to .\nA : so so it's easier to hold onto that way .\nA : course that'll then remove some of our our ball .\nA : unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part .\nA : so the grip is no , that wouldn't work either .\nA : but if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways .\nA : so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here , and then flat and then we have the problem with the hinge .\nA : so if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want .\nB : it's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so if lid is good idea .\nB : from stabil stability point of view it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , the more we sell .\nB : so it's don't make it too stable .\nA : so we don't have it flip open .\nA : we just have ball , so then we forget the ball .\nC : but then to go back to the to something along those things then .\nB : to the other design .\nA : it looks , but it's really not it's not functional .\nA : so we've got our keyboard kind .\nA : what if we flipped it around here , so that it were , that doesn't look anything like what you had there .\nA : so it's up and down , you hold it this way .\nA : course then it's it's like the rectangular again , only with couple of jutting out points .\nA : but it's one-handed .\nB : question is what makes those game pads functional ?\nB : that's the form for full hand .\nB : so it's round shape underneath that makes it comfy , , makes it , so that's the essential part .\nB : except for that we'll not probably not get get away from some longer design .\nB : 'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .\nA : because it doesn't have cord , like joysticks do .\nB : all that dif batteries , and batteries go weak as , so after while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you wanna control with it , ?\nB : so , have to show which is the front , which is the back .\nA : is it possible to have it to where it would work with like sensor on either side ?\nA : so that either way you're pointing it it would work .\nB : suppose you could do that .\nB : the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .\nA : more expensive and .\nB : course you can do that .\nB : it'll be evident after while or if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and , but it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to look at it , , which way around to point it .\nC : put it even if you designed it in some in way that , isn't rectangle , but still pointed in direction that had definite points .\nB : otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work .\nC : so if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your you kn which way you're gonna pointing it .\nD : to interrupt , but we have warning to finish .\nC : does it say what does it say for it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , .\nA : are we out of time ?\nA : , just to finish up , should we go with this plan , start making some are good ideas , what are not .\nA : must finish now , so .\nA : and then marketing will look and see what what people want .\nA : and project manager will design better meeting for next time around , be little bit more prepared .\nA : and alright , good meeting ."], ["<t> The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous

du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway .\nA : for coming to this meeting .\nA : how we doing on our remote ?\nA : we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want .\nA : alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting .\nA : see if 't get things moving along here little bit better .\nA : i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long .\nA : then believe each of you have presentation .\nA : i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want .\nA : then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully .\nA : and then we'll have the closing .\nA : which we'll have forty minutes for .\nA : let's see , the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what .\nA : i'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , and coming up with the final presentation .\nA : corinne is our marketing expert .\nA : she's gonna figure out what what the consumer wants .\nA : ryan is our user interface designer .\nA : and manuel is the industrial designer .\nA : so you're gonna come up with the ideas ryan , and you're gonna pick apart .\nA : we decided our remote , we want it to be universal remote that everyone would want .\nA : we want to be modern , fun , different .\nA : it needs to be sturdy , easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function .\nA : and we want to be different .\nA : and then we went over couple of different ideas .\nA : the keyboard shape .\nA : we decided that it should probably be one-handed .\nA : something we could use with one hand .\nA : and that was our last meeting .\nA : so why don't do each of you have presentation ?\nA : i'll hand it off to you and does anyone do you wanna go first ?\nA : so we can see what what the people want .\nD : what was it ?\nD : how do get it .\nA : to go to the next one ?\nA : you click on that guy .\nD : this is my report , which is going to be based on survey that was sent .\nD : gosh , i've no idea .\nC : just press the arrow keys .\nC : usually goes to it .\nD : actually need to see something else on my screen .\nA : hit eight again .\nA : you want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ?\nD : no want something else on mine .\nD : is that possible ?\nA : but you have to hit escape .\nA : and then you can .\nD : but now you don't have that .\nA : hit eight again .\nA : did the same thing .\nA : and then it should come up here shortly .\nD : so is there no way give you the slideshow and have something .\nA : give us the slideshow and something on your screen ?\nA : you could minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time .\nD : so first of all , the method that used was by doing some marketing research , by doing research on some interviews that were conducted .\nD : and then some internet research .\nD : and was sent report that was there were hundred remote users that they interviewed .\nD : and so will show you some of the results from that , which will be helpful .\nD : here are some of the findings .\nD : they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls .\nD : and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly .\nD : which is fairly significant number would say .\nD : and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get remote that would look fancy .\nD : so that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be modern look , that's definitely important .\nD : they say that current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .\nD : seventy five percent of users said they zap lot .\nD : and if anyone could clarify what that means ?\nD : zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ?\nC : is is it just just just using it .\nD : and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control .\nD : and there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons .\nD : and some of them it looks like barely need to be included .\nD : channel selection is used the most frequently .\nD : and then teletext was the next .\nD : volume and then power .\nD : and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used .\nD : so we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine lot of the functions into one button .\nD : the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so tracking device of some sort would be good idea .\nD : they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote .\nD : and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r_s_i_ .\nC : repetitive strain injury .\nD : what is it ?\nC : just repetitive strain injury .\nD : and so bas .\nD : as far as speech recognition goes , the younger group looks like they're all for it .\nD : from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more .\nD : and it just went down incrementally .\nD : the groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so we could discuss this and think and decide if we t's worth investing in this .\nD : at least if we're targeting the younger groups .\nD : and so in conclusion .\nD : some things that drew from this are that we were correct .\nD : we definitely need to focus on new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control .\nD : multifunctional remote could be good thing to explore .\nD : so you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room .\nD : we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose .\nD : and then lastly that we could discuss the idea of speech recognition .\nD : and that's it .\nA : now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on .\nA : can look at that real quick ?\nD : did you get time to write everything that you needed ?\nC : having just listened to what corinne just said , i'll draw on some of the things as .\nC : some things that relevant to what wanna say .\nC : so i'm just gonna approach the technical functions design .\nC : the method used was to explore the technical functions of remote control .\nC : and simplest approach that came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely .\nC : that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control .\nC : had some things sent to me .\nC : not very much .\nC : to look at similar devices .\nC : defined in some them .\nC : and then the personal preferences that will suggest .\nC : we discussed universal one .\nC : like it's just been brought up again then .\nC : but universal remote control is actually quite difficult object to design , and po possibly within the budget that we do it , because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of all the like electronic companies .\nC : i'm not have you ever come across universal remote control yourself , but you have to they're nightmare to use .\nC : you have to set them , reset them to everything .\nC : and that would only add buttons .\nC : whereas the aim is to take away buttons .\nC : so it'd be better to concentrate on just universal one for t_v_s .\nC : or just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design .\nC : here here's just two pictures of remote controls .\nC : they're just simple t_v_ remote controls .\nC : but one is user-centred .\nC : that is the one on the left .\nC : and you can straight away see there's less buttons .\nC : and the other one is engineer-centred where that's more specified for the the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and probably looking at something that should be user-centred .\nC : fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden under some remote controls you might have come across have little flip thi thing where they're hidden away .\nC : and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across .\nC : and finally , sort i've covered that , our product should be user interface orientated .\nC : like said to concentrate on t_v_ remote control , universal remote might be too complex .\nC : and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike .\nC : so that we should concentrate on something that would set trend .\nC : and then and change the fashion of remote controls .\nC : and that's it .\nA : what was your last conclusion on that one ?\nA : focus on the the image of it .\nC : on something on the image of it .\nC : the the actual design .\nB : gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors which is what dictates the design the both the interface and the outer appearance because this is all the that needs to go in there .\nB : so unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me were too drunk to actually accomplish it , so i'm going to do lot of the on the board .\nB : just this is the basic basic premise of remote control .\nB : the basic function is to send messages to another system .\nB : so much is clear .\nB : an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like chip , that can compose messages .\nB : often in the form of infrared bits .\nB : this is the most mostly used .\nB : there's also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system .\nB : parts are cheaper as .\nB : user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages .\nB : this is where my people screwed up .\nB : so i'm going to explain that on the board rather .\nB : what we have is different components that need to go in there .\nB : we'll start with an energy source .\nB : which is usually battery ?\nB : since it's not feasible to add cable to that .\nB : this energy source is connected to the the user interface itself .\nB : which can be buttons , whatever , which controls chip .\nB : this is the user interface and there we have the chip .\nB : the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp .\nB : that sends out the signal .\nB : the signal differs accordingly .\nB : depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp .\nB : and that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface .\nB : the way you normally normally do it is that you add little device such as lamp to the whole thing as , so that that it's working .\nB : you press something , you get response .\nB : which is also comparatively important on one of those devices .\nB : now this , what we're talking about here , or what should be discussed are these two components mostly .\nB : the the energy source for one thing can be altered .\nB : what we probably cannot alter is the infrared , the sending device , the infrared lamp .\nB : we cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp .\nB : these two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing .\nB : the lamp can be put onto the desi the device .\nB : it it doesn't have to be there .\nB : this can be discussed as .\nB : the user interface .\nB : that's something we can also discuss .\nB : as we've heard speech recognition is the hype in the moment .\nB : speech recognition interface , we that .\nB : or if we just do the usual button thing .\nB : or we have touch pad like that that's something we can discuss .\nB : and the energy source .\nB : it's always question whether these these components are available cheap enough , developed enough .\nB : but that's like suppose rather up to marketing , and not to to the industrial design department .\nA : so we could the the the more complex we make it , the more expensive but people have said that they would younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for speech recognition remote .\nB : expensive it's gonna be get .\nA : so possibly it might be worth the investment .\nC : speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work .\nC : 'cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and if it's on your phone .\nC : and you need to take into light languages and then different dialects suppose as .\nA : myself find , when you , when there's something like spee speech recognition .\nA : like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power .\nA : sometimes they have speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over .\nA : find myself , especially if i'm in crowd of people , looking really silly .\nA : so if you're sitting on your couch with bunch of people then , you volume up .\nC : and wou if would would you want to keep saying if you were watching .\nC : if you were watching something would you be wanting .\nA : change the channel , channel up , channel down ?\nD : another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably lot of them that's actually their parents money .\nD : like if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , fifteen year old .\nC : as t'd be the gimmick factor for the younger people .\nC : but practically don't t's .\nA : it's , it's gimmick factor that they like at first , and .\nC : it'll wear off .\nA : let's see here .\nC : do you wanna put your cord back in ?\nA : now was sent couple of things to modify our new requirements .\nA : the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided your your research showed that not only is universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly .\nA : and your re research showed that most of the people don't even use it .\nA : you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons .\nA : so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem .\nA : so we don't have to worry about that .\nA : but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics .\nA : and our corporate colours are grey and yellow .\nA : and we could probably get away with black too but so those are the three the three new requirements that that was told we need to use .\nA : from all all three of your presentations , that we were on the track lot in our last meeting .\nA : we want something that looks good .\nA : we want something that's simple .\nA : we want something that you can find easily .\nA : and the speech recognition is give or take .\nA : it's gonna cost more .\nA : the young the younger people say that they like it .\nA : but it's probably , would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time .\nA : so we should just do away with speech recognition .\nA : and that way we can focus on our form .\nC : did have have thought about the the tracking thing .\nC : is that if it came with holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it .\nC : that you you should put it back in .\nC : but if you don't put it back in , you press something like little button on that , and that just sends out beep to find where it is .\nC : just by infrared .\nC : that shouldn't be too complex would've thought .\nA : that'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball .\nC : it would be quite good .\nC : the ball could sit on .\nA : or or with with any form that that would be good .\nA : that could be the charger .\nA : for we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote .\nA : and that would be or solar .\nA : or however , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit .\nA : with the locator button .\nA : and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have flat space on it .\nA : like if we still have the how to hold on to it and it's gonna roll away .\nB : you still do .\nB : you you still .\nB : you put it on on the couch table .\nB : while you're watching , it's gonna roll off .\nB : so that's not an issue really .\nA : so after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires .\nA : and and some summaries for for what's going on .\nA : then we'll take lunch .\nA : then we can come back and work on our individual work .\nA : i'll do the minutes .\nA : it looks like you're already on your way for working with the components .\nA : chips , the what chips we need and what how to power it and whatnot .\nA : user interface concept , we want it to be something simple .\nA : minimal number of buttons .\nA : our , our main main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on certain look , .\nA : did you have time earlier to to work on that .\nA : did you feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?\nC : i'll i'll have look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break .\nC : do still needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed .\nC : the ball is probably not good idea .\nC : and even something that's held like that might be difficult .\nC : so that it still has to be variation .\nC : on rect on rectangle but not necessarily as boring , as plain as rectangle .\nA : shall we shoot for specific target group ?\nA : that way we could if it were , if we were shooting for young then it's certain look to the remote .\nA : or girls or older people ?\nA : would that you think that would help us find specific form ?\nA : that we would would wanna pick out ?\nC : if that might cope with like the trend-watching .\nC : find anything more on that .\nD : not yet but by the next meeting we'll have some info on that .\nA : so we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got colour scheme for it .\nA : yellow and yellow it's and bright , with the buttons being grey or black .\nA : and our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom or the .\nA : we could sketch so all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just rectangular sort .\nA : we could flare it .\nA : so it's more this will look like bone then .\nA : go ahead and erase this .\nA : hope everyone memorised that .\nC : you it might be to look at the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going .\nC : they've gone from big brick block things , which is remote control is , to slinky small things .\nA : everybody's got mobile phone ?\nA : except for me now .\nA : but they are all , , mobile phones they've taken turn to where they're really small .\nA : which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .\nA : but then again you don't want like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had handbag to carry it around in .\nA : so we've got what remotes look like now is what we're what we're stuck with .\nA : we could go with square .\nA : with minimal number of buttons .\nA : you've got one through nine .\nA : for typing in your channels .\nA : you've got volume , up and down .\nA : channel up and down .\nA : usually at the top .\nB : that's the classical design .\nA : that's that's all you need .\nA : menu button , .\nA : if you , if we want the remote to do other things like or the t_v_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and all those things that are built into t_v_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it .\nB : talking of which scrolling function is not not too bad .\nB : it's talk about look at that from the side , there .\nB : which is technically the easiest option .\nB : would probably be like scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this .\nA : like wheel on your mouse .\nB : you can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down .\nA : 's good idea .\nB : also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add little bulge down here .\nB : just which from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on .\nB : what i'm getting at here , fel look at it from the side .\nB : it's like that .\nB : then you hold it in your hand like this .\nB : and you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side .\nC : yes to the thumb .\nA : to the thumb .\nC : the buttons could like decrease in the bigger ones they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .\nB : you can also have it , , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open .\nB : with the lesser used functions on this part , and then it slides into that part .\nC : just like on side view .\nC : something that it would fit in the hand better .\nC : so you just have your hand .\nB : was just thinking , this this causes causes problem for left or right-handed people actually .\nC : on the and your thumb would be up here type thing .\nC : that's also true .\nC : instantly always going for the right-handed person .\nC : but the older so right-handed , .\nA : is everyone who in here's right-handed , left-handed ?\nA : you all right-handed ?\nA : so i'm left-handed but , so say that most things are designed for right-handed people .\nA : like the written language .\nD : you could buy like special left-handed version of the remote .\nA : would say it should be probably designed for right-handed person .\nA : but that's that's good .\nA : that's we've got good plan there .\nA : at least for what buttons we're gonna use .\nA : so we've got like the scroll , the scroll action and the .\nC : i'm just just thinking if it was circular with the that the early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just one-handed thing that you almost wrap round the thumb .\nC : so you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there .\nC : and then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons round here .\nC : and that could work .\nC : on any hand .\nA : kinda like holding .\nC : if you just had it like wrapped round there .\nB : that minimises it size-wise as .\nC : minimise its size .\nC : it could be really quite small .\nB : then there's another point of making it two-in-one thing .\nB : if we have smaller smaller device that actually fits into the big one .\nB : you give it the full functions in here , and just couple of functions in there .\nB : like your zap zapping device is just channels up-down , volume , and on-off .\nD : could be good .\nA : so two remotes in one .\nA : but then would be easier to lose one or the other .\nB : means the big one has to be sufficiently big .\nB : and perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around .\nB : make it piece of furniture .\nA : it actually is your coffee table .\nB : yes , there you go .\nA : need to finish up here .\nA : so for the next so for the next before the next meeting sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what new information we've got going on .\nA : manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use .\nA : let's go with our our rounded fit in your hand let's explore the the possibility of having the two-piece .\nA : so one for the the quick zapping and possibly one with just that rounded part that fits into your hand .\nA : and ryan you work on how how they'll work with the us with the user .\nC : how t'll work .\nA : so both of those concepts .\nA : and we made some good progress here .\nA : see you in .\nA : gu we'll take lunch in about half an hour .\nA : or we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting ."], ["<t> The project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fancy look and feel, are technologically innovative, easy to use, include a fruit and vegetable theme, and are spongy in feel. </t>  <t> The marketing expert stressed the need to incorporate these findings into the team's design and suggested that the team should create a remote that has limited buttons , can be personalized, and is not rectangular. </t>  <t> The user interface designer briefly described how speech recognition technology works and what ways a user can use a remote. </t>  <t> The user interface designer presented three existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote, an iPod, and a children's remote - and discussed a few features to include in the team's design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components, energy sources, and materials. </t>  <t> The industrial designer also discussed with the how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into their design. </t>  <t> The team then discussed and decided what components, materials, and energy sources to use. </t>  <t> The user interface designer will work on the user interface design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the look and feel design. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will work on a product evaluation. </t>  <t> The user interface designer and industrial designer will work on a prototype </t>  <t> The remote will use conventional batteries. </t>  <t> The case will be made of plastic with rubber grips. </t>  <t> The remote will feature a scroll function similar to the scroll function found on iPods. </t>  <t> The remote will use a more expensive, advanced chip-on-print. </t>  <t> How to have a curved remote made with rubber. </t>  <t> How to include a fruit and vegetable theme. </t>  <t> What sort of chip to use. </t>  <t> Whether to use plastic or rubber. </t> ", "A : is everyone here ?\nA : this is our conceptual design meeting .\nA : and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes .\nA : then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control .\nA : and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up .\nA : i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .\nA : we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available .\nA : we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo .\nA : and our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with hundred different remote users .\nA : with some statistics that backed what we were thinking before .\nA : people thought their remotes were ugly , that remotes zap lot .\nA : they only use finite amount of buttons .\nA : and that they often lose the it's easy to lose remote .\nA : which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple .\nA : and some locator .\nA : either button or tracking device .\nA : and that it should look different than what's out there .\nA : mixed mixed response on the speech recognition .\nA : the younger people said they wanted it , older people did not .\nA : we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably gimmick , that would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves .\nA : then the user interface designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote .\nA : the simple versus the the complex .\nA : the simple one being better for user , the complex better for an engineer .\nA : and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be user-oriented remote , something simple .\nA : and that we didn't wanna go with universal remote , because increasing cost and increasing complexity .\nA : we would just have t_v_ remote .\nA : and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote .\nA : have it be something that looks different .\nA : and finally our industrial designer gave us rundown of how the remote will work .\nA : from energy source , what we would use .\nA : batteries because we don't wanna have cable .\nA : how that would power the remote and the lamp .\nA : if we were to to have one .\nA : the user interface then would connect to chip , which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the t_v_ .\nA : believe then we came up with couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be .\nA : something that will fit into easily into someone's hand .\nA : and with , just few buttons .\nA : just the basics .\nA : and with scrolling function also .\nA : and will leave that , leave it at that .\nA : we're watching trends .\nD : can have your cable ?\nA : suppose that you can have this .\nD : so was looking at trend-watching .\nD : unfortunately wasn't given too much information .\nD : was given brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at .\nD : and then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that got from that .\nD : the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which we've already discussed before .\nD : the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative .\nD : these are all things we've already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up .\nD : and thirdly the remote would be easy to use .\nD : as far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .\nD : so that might be bit of challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try .\nD : and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel .\nD : so from that , as we've already said , we need to focus on fancy look-and-feel .\nD : we've already discovered that it's hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design .\nD : but that , even if it's very subtle , we need to trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that .\nD : for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device .\nD : we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further .\nD : and manuel had suggested the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , that we could change little bit .\nD : we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which the two piece idea might be really beneficial for .\nD : we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables .\nD : the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of fruit or vegetable .\nC : it was banana shaped .\nD : or with exterior designs .\nD : but my question is , the stereotypically speaking , you picture males with their remote controls , and i'm not how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside .\nD : so we could have something that's somewhat removable , or , different options for female , male target groups .\nD : and then the spongy feel .\nD : we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there .\nD : and look at different types of material that might our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls .\nD : so that's that .\nA : so possibly like , , just to butt in for second .\nA : possibly like cover like they have for mobile phones ?\nD : that's what was thinking .\nC : those like , , spongy ones .\nA : you have one with flag , and one with banana and one that's spongy feel to it .\nD : so when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings .\nA : you can various covers .\nC : what's it called ?\nC : cust you personalised , .\nD : personalise your remote .\nA : we could leave that to the cover department .\nA : we all know they've got nothing to do all day .\nC : why can't see the crazy .\nC : talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device .\nC : so i've looked at some of the was sent , , try and get some inspiration .\nC : but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had .\nC : was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices .\nC : they gave an example of coffee machine where you program question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly .\nC : there's different ways of user can use products like remote .\nC : there's graphical use , where you you look at pictures and on screen .\nC : command line where you type things in , and you get response .\nC : and then it ju that's just to point out the inconsistent use of interface in remotes .\nC : you can't really see that picture , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .\nC : so , then had look at new products that are on the market .\nC : not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise .\nC : this is the voice , there is voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices .\nC : have there is picture .\nC : you surf your favourite channels with your voice .\nC : store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ and audio .\nC : and you can record your own verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions .\nC : so the technology is there .\nC : the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side .\nC : you can just make those out .\nC : and then on the is an ipod , which is possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just big scroll menu that you go through .\nC : that is possibility .\nC : and nothing's simpler really .\nC : then there's things like this , which is kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before .\nC : so the remote control it only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch .\nC : and it means that children have novelty of having their own remote control .\nC : so if there's possibility of having one remote contr like we just had two components , it can have more components , different remotes .\nC : the point made at the end there here is that you have to be be need to be clear on your devices , as to what , , things you use .\nC : sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as v_ for volume .\nC : just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design .\nC : carrying on from what i've already said , user friendly remote with minimum buttons .\nC : we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have speech recognition thing , you could control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit .\nC : and then just have the simple hand-held thing that we devised earlier , as the actual remote .\nC : don't it could be graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port could have like an ipod where you just control through the menus .\nC : like gets more and more compli complicated .\nC : and then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed .\nC : and that is it .\nC : where are we ?\nC : just to show you .\nC : they've even got things like that .\nC : which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma ?\nB : that's industrial design for cranes , like that .\nB : makes sense , makes sense .\nA : notice the giant dog bone shape ?\nA : also good for animals .\nC : why's my screen crazy ?\nB : i'm going to bore you with couple of descriptions of the interior .\nB : just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the in there .\nB : i've more information on possible materials as .\nB : what we can and cannot do .\nB : but let's just for this to load up and i'll show you what we're talking about here .\nB : the details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control .\nB : the underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to row of further transistors and like that on the side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to infrared lamp which then shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it's getting and will do what you tell it .\nB : so much for the the workings of the of the remote control itself .\nB : its job is to for you to press key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television .\nB : when you press key you complete specific connection .\nB : the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed .\nB : it produces morse code line signal specific to that button .\nB : transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light .\nB : the sensor in the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately .\nB : this is the circuit board from the other side .\nB : the lower part of it , if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over .\nB : you can see the circuit board itself .\nB : that's the cheapest way to make electronic connections on the market .\nB : what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board .\nB : these are the actual keys that are being pressed .\nB : they close the electric circuit .\nB : that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side .\nB : that would be behind here .\nB : which sends it over to the transistors and all that that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there .\nB : now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it .\nB : the way it works is that you have the keys here .\nB : the rubber button has little metal plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here .\nB : and thus gives on the signal .\nB : now this is the simple version .\nB : we are talking this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time .\nB : we are talking something more complicated , it's going to be more expensive as .\nB : and not only that .\nB : we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell .\nB : i've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as .\nB : rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls .\nB : so it's pretty squishy .\nB : that would that would serve that purpose .\nB : we could also use wood , or titanium .\nA : what's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ?\nB : fya don't have an information on that .\nB : however our company can provide us with with the titanium , so assume , i'm , was given an to use it .\nB : it certainly is an expensive material , i'm aware of that , but was given an .\nB : but there are certain restrictions to certain materials .\nB : now let's first go through the list with the materials .\nB : so we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium .\nB : can also mix these .\nB : as for the energy source , we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting .\nB : what we could use is , or what was offered , or what we could use , is basic bateer battery .\nB : we could use solar cells .\nB : or device that was not not further specified that provides kinetic energy .\nB : such as like watches .\nB : where you just move them move the the actual device and this pr provides it with with some energy .\nB : so personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .\nB : you don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it ?\nB : solar cell is interesting .\nB : may fail though , every here and there .\nC : would you have to leave it by the window ?\nB : or you lose it , it lies behind the couch for week and .\nB : always the you but exactly .\nA : works arizona but in edinburgh not so no batteries are probably the way to go .\nB : the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem .\nB : you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work .\nB : so i'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery .\nB : which also makes base station obsolete .\nB : we don't need that then .\nB : however our interface options are push-buttons .\nB : in which in the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert .\nB : however we've discussed that scroll wheels are better option .\nB : and they are possible .\nB : we have an for scroll wheels .\nB : however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an into the remote control as .\nB : this however may exclude certain materials .\nB : if you have squishy remote control , then an screen may be affected by the movement .\nB : hence we might not be able to put it in there .\nB : so there's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip .\nB : if we have more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set-up that we that i've just presented , the chip has to be more more sophisticated and thus more expensive as .\nB : don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but it will be significant difference .\nB : i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really .\nB : so that's for the for the scroll wheel .\nB : it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so i'd say rather not go for for that .\nB : let's see now .\nB : solar cells cannot be used on curved or latex surface or remote control .\nB : but that's not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells , assume ?\nB : or is anybody still alright .\nB : which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional assume .\nB : with the titanium we cannot make it curved design .\nB : we would just be able to make it flat and and straight design .\nB : which assume would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions .\nC : would the spongy and the the plasticky thing you can get those mobile phones that initially have it is plastic but then they have cover on it which is just soft and .\nC : so if that would still be possible to have in plastic .\nC : but then where do people hold it ?\nC : just all be spongy .\nD : the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it .\nC : so you as the the possibility of having graphical display on it , like screen ?\nC : like the ipod ?\nB : you can have an screen .\nB : but therefore no rubber will be used .\nB : so plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will influence the form .\nB : with plastic , as understand it , you can use any form .\nB : latex is tricky .\nB : or rubber and and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form .\nB : so the way to go is if you want scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , add an screen , and then you can choose either plastic or titanium .\nB : or wood even .\nB : if you wanna make it particular shape , use plastic .\nB : add an screen , add scroll wheel , that'll be fine .\nB : or make it just push-buttons .\nB : plastic gives you the biggest variety of of options .\nB : not the nicest feel .\nB : or not much originality really .\nA : so the ru the rubbery we can shape it however we want ?\nA : or the rubbery we cannot ?\nB : with rubber we could sh shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an screen .\nB : that's the tricky thing .\nC : could we not have shape with scroll and the screen , and then just that initial shape we had , just which is banana-esque .\nC : so that's thing if we did it yellow .\nC : and you just stick on just rubber things that that grip the thumb bit .\nC : they wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior .\nC : they wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing .\nA : is that an option , plastic shell with rubbery coating on at certain spots ?\nB : certainly can be done yes .\nB : if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all .\nB : like say just the underside or so then it can be done .\nB : so the fruit design how about affecting the surface of the actual remote control ?\nB : say we don't make it particular fruit shape , but give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever .\nB : you name it .\nA : what about smell ?\nA : to the remote ?\nC : you could just sell it in different colours as suppose .\nC : in different ye yellows .\nD : bright citrus colours .\nC : don't suppose we have to stick to co stick to the colours .\nB : we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , that's yellow and grey .\nD : yellow and grey .\nA : yellow and grey .\nB : so what have we , lemon , banana , is grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps .\nA : would say , if were to make decision , would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .\nA : perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer .\nD : having shape could be little ridiculous , like kinda do .\nB : have it banana-shaped already , .\nD : and if it's yellow ?\nC : and if it if it was done yellow , which is company colour .\nA : it's it's yellow .\nB : so why not add couple of grey stripes and make it look like banana ?\nA : it's couple of couple of grey stripes .\nA : we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over .\nC : on the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey .\nA : it would look like banana just sitting on their table .\nB : there you go .\nA : rather than rather the holder , if we were to have holder , it could be shaped like fruit .\nC : it could and then you could actually put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was .\nD : could look like fruit bowl .\nB : it could be an ape .\nA : could be , it could be an ape or fruit bowl .\nA : we could have variety of options here .\nA : do you have more to your presentation ?\nB : informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go .\nA : i'm gonna plug in here real quick .\nB : there you go .\nA : like said we have to make decision on couple of these items here .\nD : so is the two piece idea out ?\nD : or have we not decided ?\nC : rid of that because gonna use battery .\nC : and the base station might not be necessary .\nB : can still design two-piece remote without having base , having one of them be base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece .\nB : we can still do that .\nB : however this would be like designing two remotes .\nB : so which then , as understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive .\nB : say like have scroll wheel and on both of them , or have an screen and so on so on .\nB : you'd probably have to stick rather with just traditional rubber button design which we saw there .\nB : but could be done , .\nA : so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting .\nA : for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , the chip-on-print , and the case .\nA : probably case material .\nA : and probably shape also .\nA : and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is .\nA : and what supplements we'll have .\nA : energy source we've , we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet .\nA : and we have five minutes .\nB : when it comes to the chip-on-print , as said , the the more advanced features you want , the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive .\nB : if you want just normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be cheap one .\nA : so we should pick the case then .\nA : if we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , then the chip-on-print is still , we could have either or .\nA : we could have complex one or non-complex .\nA : but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?\nD : what about what you said , like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic ?\nC : just little bit of .\nA : so we would , we would have the screen ?\nB : as long as the pla the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes .\nA : so the case would be plastic , with perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it .\nA : it's more of su it's more of supplement .\nB : more of lamination perhaps .\nD : so then for the scroll , are we going for the ipod type ?\nA : which will require more expensive chip-on-print ?\nA : so that , is that , is that about it ?\nA : so we have good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ?\nA : so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes .\nA : here's what's gonna be going on .\nA : ryan you'll be working on the user interface design .\nA : manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design .\nA : corrine we'll want product evaluation .\nA : and the two of you get to play with the modelling components and and and get us prototype .\nA : which should go along with your look-and-feel design and your interface .\nA : so that just be working on the prototype , we'll accomplish your other two actions .\nA : let's do it ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The industrial

minutes from the previous meeting .\nA : and then we'll have , the prototype presentation .\nA : then we will do an evaluation .\nA : or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation .\nA : then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .\nA : then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall in line .\nA : let's see , minutes from the last meeting .\nA : we looked at the the trends .\nA : we had the fashion trends that people want fancy look-and-feel .\nA : it was twice as important as anything else .\nA : they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .\nA : and spongy feel .\nA : so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype .\nA : they wanted limited buttons and simplicity .\nA : then we looked at the the method for coming up with our own remote .\nA : looking at other other devices .\nA : the ipod , we really liked the look of that .\nA : we also had the kid's remote for simple idea .\nA : two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at .\nA : and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use .\nA : but we've still decided not to go with that .\nA : then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , and made decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .\nA : and how , what were making for the prototype .\nA : so i'm going to leave it at that and let you take over .\nC : the prototype discussion .\nA : do you need this ?\nC : there is our remo the banana .\nB : can try to plug that in there but .\nC : we we st went with the colour yellow .\nC : working on the principle of fruit which was mentioned , it's designed around banana .\nC : but it would be held in such fashion , where it is , it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic .\nC : these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips .\nC : so that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it .\nC : but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel .\nC : you have to use your imagination little bit .\nC : and this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .\nC : and the the simplest functions would be almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way other way through channels .\nC : volume up and down .\nC : and then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus .\nC : it's that that simple .\nC : that just represents the infrared beam .\nC : that's simple on and off switch .\nC : we could use the voice .\nC : that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be suppose .\nC : and that's about it .\nC : it's as simple as you , we could make it really .\nC : is there anything you want to add ?\nB : that's what we have there .\nB : plastic covered with rubber .\nB : we might add some more underneath here .\nB : give it , give it form .\nB : you're supposed to hold it like that , but just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so , you have some rub .\nC : doesn't make much make much difference .\nC : you could work left-handed or right-handed suppose .\nB : exactly , use both .\nB : might as think about think about the button as .\nC : the actual thing might be smaller .\nB : like either put either one one on either side or not do it .\nA : what but what's that button ?\nC : just the on and off .\nB : it's quick on-off button .\nB : that's it's pretty important .\nB : so you don't have to fiddle with that .\nB : that's not i'd say bit smaller would probably be .\nB : you wanna play with that over there .\nB : there you go .\nC : it's it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy play-doh , but and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything suppose .\nA : would you like to done .\nC : with the scroll and the .\nA : luckily we are going to find out .\nA : or not luckily .\nA : do you have marketing presentation for us .\nD : you are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria .\nD : so first i'll just discuss some of the criteria that found .\nD : just based on the past trend reports that was looking at earlier .\nD : and then we'll do group evaluation of the prototype .\nD : and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did .\nD : so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier .\nD : so we're gonna be doing it based on seven point scale .\nD : and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that .\nD : with seven being false , we did not achieve that .\nD : so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?\nA : it's definitely different than anything else out there .\nA : so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes would say , would say most definitely .\nC : it's it's curved .\nA : it still has your traditional black .\nC : it's not there's no sharp angles to it .\nB : i'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .\nB : however the colour , we don't have say in that .\nD : the colours detract little bit .\nC : some people might say it .\nB : that has been , that has been dictated by the company .\nB : so to answer that honestly would rather say like , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .\nB : 's nothing you can say about that .\nB : much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .\nA : something more modern to go modern colour to go with the modern form .\nB : you don't want your three feet huge dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .\nD : so , do you think , since we this was sign criteria , do you think we should put it somewhere in the middle then ?\nD : does that sound good ?\nD : what do you think ?\nA : would say four .\nD : four is fair .\nA : very non-committal , four .\nD : the second one .\nD : did we make it simple for new users ?\nB : it's very intuitive , .\nC : that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .\nB : give it one .\nD : do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?\nD : i'd say that so one ?\nC : 'cause we've we've brought it down to four controls most common , which are channel and volume .\nC : and then the other ones are just matter of just going , just scrolling further .\nA : scrolling through and selecting few .\nB : so that's one .\nD : the fourth one .\nD : how about the problem of remote being easily lost ?\nD : one of the number one complaints .\nB : something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .\nD : whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .\nC : it's bright yellow .\nC : bright yellow's hard to lose .\nC : but if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition .\nC : that , we could just use that solely for the the finding thing .\nC : that was what we'd we'd mentioned .\nA : so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could and it is quite bright and .\nC : just just to use , to find it when it was lost .\nC : but like said , like don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily .\nC : and it's not gonna fall , like rectangle would slip down behind things .\nC : that's gonna be difficult shape to .\nC : in the middle again , three or four ?\nC : loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , million ways .\nC : you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it .\nA : but if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite bit .\nA : if we eliminate the fact that it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then i'd say two .\nA : with the speech recognition , which may be changed depending on budget .\nB : you could add an extra feature actually .\nB : which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .\nB : we could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .\nA : which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just some proximity pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece .\nC : but just those whistling , clapping key rings you have .\nB : it's it's the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping .\nC : so it can't be that expensive .\nB : that can't cost much .\nB : so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and the other .\nC : stick it on the t_v_ .\nB : that'd be tough then .\nB : also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole you your television , .\nB : ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .\nD : are we adding one of these two features ?\nB : let's add one of those features and say yes .\nD : so we're back to one ?\nD : are we technologically innovative ?\nB : it's all just it's all just stolen technology when it comes down to .\nC : i'd say so .\nC : don't get many mo remote controls with screens on .\nC : it's stolen technology .\nA : it's but there's not lot of yellow , there's not lotta yellow .\nC : but we have .\nD : but for remotes .\nA : course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour .\nC : fa 'cause it's stolen .\nA : that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .\nD : but how many remotes do you see like this ?\nD : not so many .\nA : if we added the screaming factor then we go up .\nA : would say we're probably at four .\nD : that's gonna hurt us .\nB : you have that , , .\nA : we have some spongy , .\nC : as much as as needed , .\nB : it's not one though .\nB : one would be the whole thing to fold and .\nA : because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back .\nB : so that's four at most .\nA : probably four at most .\nD : and lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?\nA : possibly even five .\nD : i'd say we did .\nA : if your fashion is is carmen miranda , you betcha .\nB : more the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is .\nC : be what we were told , and they'd say , definitely .\nD : now we just gotta calculate .\nD : six eight twelve sixteen .\nD : seventeen divided by eight .\nA : seven is two point two point four ?\nC : is that some long division ?\nD : haven't done math in years .\nC : just , i'm there's .\nD : we'll say two point four two .\nD : how does that look ?\nB : 't do that without calculator .\nC : no 't do long very impressive .\nD : it's been while .\nA : and what what is the acceptable criteria ?\nA : is there like scale that we have to hit ?\nD : they just told me to pick my own criteria and have you evaluate it .\nD : so that's that .\nA : now we get to do the budget numbers .\nA : you didn't know that you were gonna have budget .\nA : but we do .\nC : you'd been going long time dividing that .\nC : it's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on .\nC : two point four two .\nD : we'll go with that .\nD : not too shabby .\nA : so have here an .\nB : fifty percent , you're kidding .\nB : it's too much .\nA : we want fifty percent profit on this .\nA : you can't really see that very .\nC : charge about three hundred quid for it .\nA : twelve and half euros is what supposed to cost us .\nA : so let's see .\nA : the the wonder if make this what the it won't let me do that .\nA : alright so at top , if you can read that or not .\nA : 't 'cause don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source .\nA : there's four , five , six categories .\nA : we have energy source , electronics , case .\nA : then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements .\nA : so first of all energy source , we picked battery .\nA : and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?\nA : probably some either two or four .\nB : at four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem .\nB : people can change it every month .\nB : they won't know until after they bought it .\nA : this is consumerism .\nA : alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker .\nC : we're advanced chip are we ?\nB : that's the advanced chip-on-print , .\nA : we have one of those .\nA : then the case is probably it's double curved .\nB : double curved , yes .\nA : case materials are plastic .\nA : it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom .\nA : is that or is it just one ?\nB : no that's just one .\nA : it's one because of the .\nB : it's just one mo single mould , we can do that .\nA : it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is .\nB : that's not special colour .\nB : it's specially ugly colour , but it's not special .\nA : we have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an display .\nA : so we actually have the display and then is it the integrated or is it .\nC : and then i'd say the integrated .\nB : we could make the buttons wood .\nB : say mahogany or so or titanium .\nD : it'd look really lovely .\nA : they cost us all the same .\nB : just that's too much .\nA : only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements .\nC : no that's getting bit tiny .\nC : i'd ignore that .\nD : leave it blank .\nA : we're gonna leave that one blank because we run on and scroll .\nA : so our total is fifteen point five .\nA : which believe is by three euros over .\nB : it's hard to believe .\nB : so we'll go for the hand dynamo ?\nA : so the only thing better than banana-shaped remote is one that you shake .\nC : if it what if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on .\nC : and just had scroll wheel interface .\nC : and the display .\nC : suppose the c_ display's the one that's pushing it up bit though .\nA : 'cause the 'cause we have to have both ?\nB : let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television .\nB : you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen .\nB : so let's take away the .\nC : you could take out the dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t_v_ itself .\nA : so we may not need the display ?\nC : that is possible .\nB : we may not need it .\nB : there you go .\nA : there we go .\nC : there we go .\nA : twelve point five .\nA : so we just remove our screen here .\nC : make it bigger dial .\nC : easier to use .\nC : even easier to use then .\nA : besides look at what the does to our lovely remote .\nB : the so we can just take away heck of lot of the there you go .\nA : back to the design room boys .\nD : what's the blue part ?\nC : that was just we ran out of yellow .\nD : that's the batteries .\nB : there you go .\nC : there you go .\nD : looks more like banana .\nC : for all those fruit lovers out there .\nB : there you go .\nB : one more criteria .\nA : so the costs under twelve point five euro .\nA : we redesigned it .\nA : now it's yes .\nA : project process , satisfaction with , , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found .\nA : so that let's see here .\nA : that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me .\nA : but i'd like to hear your thoughts .\nD : trying to fill in some time there .\nA : what did you think of our project process ?\nC : we did we did quite .\nB : just half day , you have remote .\nB : there you go .\nC : from the start of the day .\nA : we st we started off little little weak .\nC : we knew where we were going straight away .\nA : our leadership was quite weak in the beginning .\nA : but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing .\nA : room for creativity ?\nA : there was that .\nA : we tried lotta different things and it was interesting as you brought up more information and studies that we were on with lot of those things .\nA : you worked together as team .\nA : and the means ?\nA : which was the whiteboard and the pens .\nC : we've used the whiteboard .\nA : had some problem with the pen , but minus your have we have list of employees that you would like fired .\nD : minus your powerpoint fiasco .\nB : that's not my fault .\nB : that's the people work for that work for me , they've just heads are gonna roll , believe me .\nA : new ideas found ?\nA : yes for the remote .\nA : no not for technology .\nA : costs are within the budget .\nA : project is evaluated .\nA : complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary .\nA : and still have to do my minutes for the last meeting .\nA : so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up .\nD : we might have while though .\nA : and then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that .\nA : but that's the end of our meeting ."], ["<t> The meeting begins with the group trying to resolve some equipment issues and waiting for Anna's arrival. </t>  <t> Then the project manager introduces the meeting by saying they have some technical tools with which to communicate so they will try to get acquainted with them first. </t>  <t> He starts talking about the product they are to design, a remote control which should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. </t>  <t> The general outline of the project will be the functional, conceptual, and detailed design. </t>  <t> They do some tool training by trying out the whiteboard, and each person draws his/her favorite animal on it. </t>  <t> The project manager proceeds to talk about the project finance, which is followed by a group discussion about what functions a good remote control has. </t>  <t> This includes the basics such as on/off, channel up/down browsing, volume and record button(s). </t>  <t> At this point they clarify their names and roles in the group and then resume talking about remote control functions. </t>  <t> They discuss some functions such as a personal video recorder, but say it is probable that they cannot produce a fancy device given their budget. </t>  <t> The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what he/she will be working on. </t>  <t> The interface designer will work on a general design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the technica function design. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will think about user requirements. </t>  <t> The selling price of the product will be about twenty five Euros each. </t>  <t> The production cost will be twelve Euros and fifty cents. </t>  <t> The profit will be about fifty million Euro. </t>  <t> -The remote will target an international market. </t>  <t> The remote will be for use with the television set. </t>  <t> The necessary buttons are on/off, channel up/down browsing, volume, and record button(s). </t>  <t> They have not decided what functions the remote can have, but they have discussed that they may not be able to produce something extremely fancy with the given budget. </t>  <t> They will need to examine user requirements before deciding on what functionalities are necessary. </t> ", "D : or you get it .\nC : no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length .\nB : so we we will for anna , few minutes .\nD : yours is but the the mic should not .\nC : you can put anywhere you want , actually .\nC : thin it's not directional mic , anyway .\nB : it should work like this .\nB : so will try to get my presentation running .\nD : can't help you with that .\nB : it's no matter .\nD : then press al this .\nB : on this normal good .\nB : doesn't appear on the screen here .\nB : yes and you can put can clip it on your somewhere .\nB : so , good morning , everyone .\nB : welcome at at the kick off meeting of our latest project .\nB : hope you all have been updated about it .\nB : so we will try to structure this meeting with an with an agenda as presented here .\nB : after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other .\nB : see what our roles are in this project .\nB : so , we have been provided with some technical tools to to communicate and to , learn from each other's plans as say so we will also try to to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me whether you worked with them before .\nB : then we will come to the to the to the actual project plan .\nB : you all hope how it's about the new remote control we are going going to design .\nB : then we will discuss , , how it should be and wh what what our new product should look lite like .\nB : and then after some twenty five minutes hope we can end this meeting .\nB : this is about new remote control .\nB : we when you design new product you of you want it to be original .\nB : be we want to be distinguished , ?\nB : people want to when they look at the shelf want to think , that's the product need .\nB : so it needs to be trendy .\nB : trendy is what people want , so then they will buy our product .\nB : but then , , it also should work user friendly and otherwise people will not be be rated very consumer articles and like that .\nB : so , the general outline of new project will be we first go through functional design phase .\nB : you all get certain task in this in this phase and then we will meet again and discuss this functional design .\nB : and the same holds for the ph two phases after this , the conceptual design and after that more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape .\nB : alright , but first we will do some tool training .\nB : in all in front of you you see the notebooks and note blocks and we have here white-board .\nC : whitebo , you can start it .\nB : and should work i've read it from my from some colleague that it should work with some toolbar .\nB : didn't find out yet how it work , but one of you did , so yes .\nD : under documents in the shared folder .\nB : do do we have to say something about that ?\nB : i'm not fully updated about this shared folder .\nD : we'll have shared folder with documents that we can share .\nB : yes will then find out ho how it works .\nB : this seems to me , yes , some computer program but didn't find it yet .\nB : so , we'll come to that later .\nB : so , now we will try out the white-board we have here .\nB : so , would suggest , yes , we we should try to to draw on it and then should be smart some way .\nD : each of us is going .\nB : i'm not really how this works , but yes , good idea mael .\nA : for us it's just like normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .\nD : so , but it's actually , not go with .\nC : no they will record through that .\nC : there's sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make .\nA : but for us it's just like normal whiteboard .\nB : you you doesn't it work ?\nB : someo anna , you can start .\nB : then he can find out to get his cord .\nA : have to draw .\nB : so why don't you draw your favourite animal on on on the white-board .\nA : my my favourite animal .\nA : this is all tangled up here .\nB : so draw it .\nB : we will try to what it is .\nA : i'm very bad drawer .\nA : you're not gonna be able to from my drawing .\nA : i'm bad drawer .\nA : they're ears , by the way .\nA : so like pet animal .\nB : it's like cat , so it's cat .\nA : no , not cat though .\nB : what is this now ?\nC : you forget about it .\nD : you're on the knife .\nC : don't want to carry it off .\nC : man , this wires , ?\nC : we need wireless microphone .\nC : pro specially we should next project we should take like that .\nB : so , that's the cat .\nA : it's not cat , it's dog .\nB : so but that's also cat , isn't it ?\nC : the dog doesn't have tail ?\nA : it's got tail then .\nB : bo both predators .\nC : the dogs have tail .\nA : so do cats .\nB : did you work out cord ?\nA : and you guessed cats without tail .\nD : will go without without it , ?\nC : it'll still not extend , ?\nC : it's not up to that .\nA : there you go .\nA : so what favourite characteristics .\nA : dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun .\nA : this is why you're the designer .\nA : and i'm marketing .\nB : yes , yes this is yes definitely horse .\nB : so suppose it yes .\nC : you can put that .\nA : blue and black zebra .\nB : can you can meet them in africa , .\nB : so ma matthew ?\nA : the very rare blue zebras .\nC : i'll tell to get it off my ?\nB : so hope you have some space in your the horse of mael .\nA : you got lot of room here .\nA : you can probably reach .\nC : it's not for that .\nC : so what should draw ?\nC : he has already to do cat .\nB : this looks likes cat who has been driven over .\nD : and we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , ?\nB : yes , the moustache .\nB : that's that's definitely cat .\nD : and they like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this .\nB : it's quite , relaxed situation .\nD : she has the small legs .\nA : it's very big rat .\nA : or very small cat .\nB : yes , this is certain some contribution to our project .\nD : and you , bird .\nB : which animal has not been drawn yet .\nB : so you've all drawn land animals , so why not draw an animal from the water .\nD : in the water .\nA : what that is .\nA : it's bit it's bit hard to .\nC : so the cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ?\nD : put it colours .\nD : it would help us .\nD : with different pen widths .\nA : it's shark now .\nB : so , yes , why not ?\nD : it's shark , .\nC : it's baby shark , it looks to me , it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ?\nA : now it's swordfish .\nD : you have some in in australia , ?\nA : i've never seen one , no .\nB : hope it still works .\nB : so , this this tool seemed to work .\nD : so if we need to spend time on that , actually but , exactly , .\nC : you should go for the next one it seems to me .\nB : let's continue to to the real .\nB : our project finance thing .\nB : when we are and when you are going to design we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about twenty five euros , so when designing project also look at you mael , keep in mind people want to get the feeling this is twenty five euro project pr product .\nD : per remote control , ?\nB : more interesting for our company , profit aim , about fifty million euro .\nB : so we have to sell quite lot of this things .\nB : we will try to to get at international market so it will be mainly europe and northern america , some asian countries .\nC : the sale man , four million .\nB : also important for you all is the the product production cost must be maximal twelve twelve euro and fifty cents .\nD : so it's half of the selling price , if am good in mathematics .\nB : we still have to to make profit , ?\nC : they have to sell at least four million to make profit we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit .\nB : you all have to be paid .\nD : you're very good in mathematics .\nC : fifty mill it should have on off button .\nB : so when we are working on the international market , in principle it has enough customers so when we have good product we we could meet this this aim , .\nB : so , that about finance .\nB : and now just let have some discussion about what is good remote control and keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly .\nB : someone can mention some additional prerequisites for good remote control .\nB : yes , it should have the the the the expected functionality of remote control .\nC : and it depends what application you are using it for .\nC : you might need we are targ targeting the television set .\nB : we wer we were thinking television .\nC : so , you need to record the channels .\nC : you need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way , and , and marketing .\nB : yes , yes .\nB : that's very handy always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have lot of channels .\nD : and just before starting the detailed discussion , we you are the marketing guy ?\nD : or so you are the marketing .\nD : and you are in the use user interface design .\nD : so just wanted to to be .\nD : and i'm the the industrial designer .\nD : because you very , actually , but .\nD : happy to meet you .\nD : it's very so just on your web page but not not face to face .\nC : and matthew , .\nB : and i'm nanne .\nB : are there some other very important things to to do , to specify in this first phase of of the project .\nD : so so like what ?\nC : so and , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you today we have teletext and all those things .\nB : so the browse function , as you mentioned .\nC : tomorrow you might have some more functions which might come through that , so i_p_o_ or .\nD : like internet on the on t_v_ ?\nC : now we are looking for television things or i_p_ .\nC : personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .\nA : but we can't really design that hasn't been invented yet .\nC : it's it's it's it's coming up , actually .\nC : the personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up .\nB : you two should should , , think this over espec what , what functionality .\nD : actually , , and first before designing the func thinking about the functionalities , we need to are the user requirements .\nC : let's let's take in that case you can you always hook up with someone who is providing that and , you you sell their product as as your product with them , .\nD : then if they need internet , then we would be able to to to propose something with t_v_ over i_p_ .\nD : but before , but we want to design new one .\nA : but ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .\nB : keep keep in mind it's it's twenty five euro unit , so the the very fancy we can leave that out , .\nB : so twenty five euro you expect quite , normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .\nA : so try and get t_v_ manufacturers to .\nC : no , it's , understand .\nC : so we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then .\nD : the , the main is browsing .\nB : yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons that will be on it .\nB : we can discuss that in the in the next meeting .\nB : would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting .\nB : so so now the basic the basic things .\nC : we are alread .\nB : and just just for the next meeting , , , you wor yes , work on design , keep it general , so we will be still fle flexible with adding some functions .\nB : so you will be working on on technical function design , so and you and you and , think about requirements , ?\nB : does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television interface .\nB : so , we should now all go work at this and you will be informed via email and other communication .\nB : so next meeting will be in in thirty minutes .\nB : keep it in mind ."], ["<t> The project manager opens the meeting and presents the agenda using slides. </t>  <t> The marketing expert explains the research she read about, which is a study done on 100 people asking their remote usage habits and preferences. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer presents, explaining the basic function of a remote control and how it works. </t>  <t> He says they should first agree on the technical functions before he creates working design and chooses the chips and infrared components to build it. </t>  <t> The Interface Designer gives his presentation, talking about the remote's technical function of sending a message to the TV set that is decoded by the TV. </t>  <t> Standard TV remotes have an on/off button, play, volume change, number keypad, and a 1 or 2 digit option. </t>  <t> He suggests that in aiming for the next generation they should have a remote for the TV and video integrated together. </t>  <t> The project manager recieves a message from account manager, which he shares with the group. </t>  <t> They discuss and determine the target group as well as the possibility of making a universal remote for stereo, VCR, and TV. </t>  <t> They close the meeting with the project manager telling each group member what they will do before the next meeting. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will try to find out which components are needed. </t>  <t> The interface designer will get more specific user interface content. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will look at what trends are in this type of market </t>  <t> They will target the 20-40 age group. </t>  <t> Teletext is a well known feature of televisions but is no longer in frequent use because of the internet, will not be used. </t>  <t> The remote should be trendy as possible but still have a reliable image so that it does not appear poorly-functional. </t>  <t> The group is interested in creating a universal remote, however they are unable to deterine what components are needed without looking at the standards and current trends in the market. </t>  <t> One group member brought up that it is not possible to make a universal high-performance remote with the given budget. </t>  <t> More research is necessary to determine this. </t> ", "B : so see all everybody's here , .\nB : and we can start meeting .\nA : what's the agenda for this meeting ?\nB : the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you .\nB : as you can see here .\nB : so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you .\nB : i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too .\nD : so you are the secretary also .\nB : then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .\nB : we will in minute we will start with them .\nB : we will see in which order we will handle them of .\nB : then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it .\nB : about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes .\nD : you mean the social target group who we wants to target ?\nD : the customers , .\nB : think that's that's important matter .\nA : that's the big question .\nB : so and then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we'll we'll have lunch .\nB : why anna can you do you have presentations ?\nA : no , don't .\nB : you don't have presentation ?\nB : you want table to to yes yes you can can just talk about it or you can use the whiteboard if necessary .\nA : talk about it but have no slides or anything .\nA : 've just been presented with some research we've done in small focus group so , hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in remote control .\nA : it's probably can't email this to you , i've just got web page with some data on it .\nA : it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls .\nA : seventy five seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .\nA : eighty percent of users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .\nA : current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .\nA : seventy five percent of users said they zap lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television .\nA : fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got remote control with lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use small part of that .\nB : do you do you have this information on the web page you said ?\nA : have an web page yes .\nB : yes , mayb you can can send an email to me later .\nA : so there's breakdown of how much they use the different functions on rem remote control .\nA : power and volume selection are only used few times within this per hour .\nA : channel selection is used hundred and sixty eight times and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently .\nA : teletext is used fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used .\nA : an interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to lot of users .\nB : yes yes , have that too .\nA : thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .\nD : it's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's too much time to learn .\nA : thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use new one .\nD : not enough you cannot put this webpage online on the it's it it's webpage on the c_ it's file .\nA : and thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .\nA : how we'd go about combating that .\nC : what do you mean there ?\nA : respet repetitive strain injury .\nB : they think that or do their doctor the doctor says ?\nB : but it's it's the opinion of the of the users ?\nA : that's what the report says .\nA : and then it's got demographic breakdown on should be able to actually , if email it to you now .\nC : you can disconnect it there no ?\nB : you can just just .\nC : then you can connect this one or this one .\nD : you can connect this one .\nC : all to your computer .\nD : so these are important numbers that matthew and need to take into account for our functional these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the both user interface and functional design .\nA : need to muck around with this .\nA : it's probably easier if you put it on yours and then i'll just email it to you .\nA : it's just web link .\nA : one thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on minute .\nD : because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint our design based on what is more important .\nA : one thing is interesting is talking about speech recognition in remote control .\nD : speech recognition in .\nA : and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .\nB : do you have numbers on that ?\nA : yes , i'll just get this up .\nD : so that we don't do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech .\nA : potentially , even for interesti that would not work so .\nA : you wanna have both options .\nB : would it would be solution for when your remote control is lost , when it has speech recognition then then it doesn't matter where it is , my t's we should be in range , or it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is .\nB : but the these are all quite fancy features i'm not whether we will we can make this for for twelve euro fi and fifty cents .\nC : would be no you can't .\nD : and we where the state of the art of speech recognition is , ?\nC : it depends like there is it's very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , .\nD : but it's quite noisy if there is the t_v_ shouting .\nC : it's it's going to be li it's not going to be so easy but usually it's going to be more of an isolated case but it's but with twenty fi it's decline .\nB : yes , that that that that's .\nB : do you have some more important facts or can we go to the next presentation ?\nA : this is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in remote control , who would pay more for it , .\nD : so you had to to to summarise the .\nA : ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .\nA : but we sh , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , , which we'll be talking about later .\nB : decline with age , .\nB : we will talk about it later .\nA : did you get the email ?\nA : just follow that link .\nD : thi you us .\nA : it'll be in different window , .\nA : that's left that one .\nA : so that's the figure that was just talking about there , with the different demographics .\nA : another thing it's talking about there is the screen but there's no figures on that .\nB : mael can you give your presentation ?\nD : stay move as far as take your chair ?\nB : this is , you can move , .\nC : now you can move .\nB : you can you can sa take my chair .\nC : it's channel selection , module , this and this function , go to the .\nD : so as everybody knows i'm the industrial designer .\nD : and in this presentation this group presentation is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control .\nD : i'd like first to give quick very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have very technical background what is it because in the product it is important .\nD : so the basic function of remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed .\nD : and so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually through infrared bit and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright .\nD : so my method for designing the the work design first the the main point is that would wish to to make really functional product .\nD : would prefer to have very functional capabilities rather than fancy that is not used and doesn't work .\nD : so for that as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing expert anna and to to we should agree on what are the technical functions for this remote control and show you the the working design .\nD : so here is really large view of what we want .\nD : we want an on off button , it can be it's simple but it's it's important , and also the to both channels as as other buttons that come after , .\nD : so the components quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is will be to my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control .\nD : so we need energy sources and the receiver receiver .\nD : this is very quick design , you stop me or interrupt me if you don't agree on it on that .\nD : and so what have found and after lot of work actually draw this draw for you this schema that can be too technical for you but is very important for me .\nA : you drew it long time ago ?\nD : and that's it so won't go into details about that but these are my preferences to use that components .\nB : and and why do you want these component ?\nB : are they cheap , or are they reliable ?\nB : what were your .\nD : so the the main components you see here are the cheapest have found and you have always compromise with reliability and if it's expensive , but this one was not this one also really reliable so that's it for the working design , hope you get clearer view on what what remote control is in terms of technical components but no no no no we we will this is preference but we can always change .\nB : it it it's more clear now .\nC : but is it can you just buy it on the market and plug it in or you want to ma to du it's just you had to change the frequencies .\nB : what what was thinking about the the the schema about the sender and the receiver , can you can you get back to it ?\nB : the receiver is already in the television and we are not able to change it .\nB : so we we must adapt to the to the receiver .\nB : suppose there is standard way of communicating to televisions .\nD : we will use infrared protocol using infrared and and we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is adapting the the chips inside to the best chips and infrared bubbles .\nD : in the chip you have it .\nC : but you should be careful , people are sometime becoming problem , like guy has recently designed remote which could switch off any other t_v_s , so through all the things .\nD : that can control other things .\nC : so we should think of .\nD : we should take that into account in the yes .\nB : yes feel mael will will consider this these things .\nA : so if the t_v_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off .\nC : so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's t_v_ and you can just walk away you don't have to be near the t_v_ .\nA : like that idea .\nB : we can go to to your presentation matthew .\nB : assume you were finished here .\nC : so take mine now there .\nC : take mine it's , voila , so .\nB : know where it is .\nC : it's on the desktop .\nC : so i'm going to talk little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , my last presented what is going inside , so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it .\nC : so the approach is that the idea is to send message to the t_v_ set , as mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the t_v_ and usually we it is easier to have keys or buttons with which people can press and then changing button will change the message which is being sent to the t_v_ and and it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver .\nC : so as anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to press the keys , people are can have speech recognition but this is question which will we have to see later .\nC : but in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends message to the t_v_ .\nC : and so generally don't have some figures but so there are two kinds of remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have standard t_v_ remote where you have just on , off button and play , volume change and keys for the number and more than one digit option .\nC : and if you see righ now even the one on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but .\nC : then there is this is the standard one with without any fancy thing like it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's very simple thing , which which you can vouch .\nC : and then you have what's the video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop and then you play the movie or or fo fast forward the movie like that so it has those so these are the standard commonly found remote controls in the market .\nC : and then whi which is generally used by the people .\nC : and then personal preferences would think of having aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the the t_v_ and the remote video remote control because some of the keys in the video's remote control and the t_v_ they could be integrated together so that we could aim for the like in the coming future that type of applications with .\nA : how would that work ?\nA : so you've got say v_c_r_ and t_v_ which are separate , so you on my one at home i've got v_c_r_ remote which then changes the channel on the v_c_r_ and doesn't do anything on the t_v_ , so is it gonna be like switch on the remote that says use the t_v_ or use the v_c_r_ ?\nA : or does it know which one you want to use ?\nC : actually you could you could think of having you can have key which could tell it could go to the video thing but yo you you you still can't in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the v_c_r_ option and you could play it or you can also think about having like in few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have system where you have separate sitting setup box and you have something like you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and you can just when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch program .\nC : in that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those functionalities .\nD : these are next generation functionalities .\nC : it's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years .\nB : yes , but it's it's already there , the hard disk recorders i've seen them in the shop .\nC : it's goi it's .\nC : so it's going to record your things and you and you you need the functionalities what you need in both video as as in the standard t_v_ thing .\nA : that's fair enough .\nA : but don't think we're trying to make universal remote here .\nC : no no we are not making universal remote , we are just looking at giving scenario , have t_v_ and tomorrow am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and it's going to do that job for me .\nB : we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this .\nB : mean , you can go pretty far with with with functions and possible future prospects yes .\nC : so so that ends my presentation .\nB : but it's good to keep in mind .\nC : so we can always discuss about it the presently the video market actually this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually so it like people are providing like things like movies , you can select actually so you want to watch movie and your your provider gives list of movies , and then you select those list .\nC : and it you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your t_v_ .\nC : and thi this is going to come .\nD : or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed online .\nC : it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time want to watch the movie and so .\nB : so have received some some some some points of of thinking over of my account manager and would like to share them with you .\nB : first thing is teletext is known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less .\nB : that's that's especially because of the internet .\nB : so we should think about it .\nB : do we include it , and do we give it prominent prominent place on on on the on on the remote mot control itself .\nB : as in any case it's it's not used , very much , but it's it is still used .\nB : further yes we must think , do we stay to to television only , the television as we as we all with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back , or do we go further as matthew indicated by supporting recording devices ?\nA : so d_v_d_s and v_c_r_s ?\nB : and and and the hard disk recorders .\nB : furthermore , , we need really need to interest younger customers and then with younger customers people below the age of forty , and our our current customers are mainly forty plus which forty .\nD : fourteen or for .\nB : so that's to that's there's market but they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people .\nB : therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's we should make our our our r_c_ as trendy as possible but it should also be have reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think does it work .\nC : it's you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like keys separately , but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like it is like so .\nB : ma you can draw it on the on the board .\nA : but taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after younger market , that's the the the the new and the funky things , that's , , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls .\nB : yes yes mo yes it's recognisable .\nD : because they are already used to that , , product .\nB : and and they are skilled by using it .\nC : so , it works .\nC : so , you have presently keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and four five six like that and you can have keys like this in form like keys like that forty minutes ?\nB : mael can you hand me over this ?\nA : how much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ?\nB : fi five min .\nA : 'cause we haven't talked about demographic and it's very important issue .\nC : so you you you can have keys like which are which are like so .\nC : too , so we don't change the original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they don't look so there there is very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , four , four here five and six , so the keys can be it looks not very much cluttered but it looks for you don't have too many keys but you can have lot of options if you press on the to .\nB : now that the idea's clear .\nB : we should now try to decide on our target group .\nA : which is quite tricky .\nA : we're trying to get people to buy remote control wouldn't they already have remote control with their television when they buy one ?\nB : they have already one .\nB : so our our our remote control has to be better .\nA : but it's not going to have more functionality , 'cause it's only low market , it's cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on the look of it , the design of it but that's not big seller , if they're not just going to buy new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as .\nA : so i'm not how we can get people to buy this thing .\nB : many people said in your in in your research the appearance of the r_c_ is is important when they are buying one but .\nA : but why are they buying one in the first place ?\nB : so that will be about functionality .\nA : but if people are buying new remote control for functionality they'll buy universal remote .\nA : i've got friends who've got so many things they need universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things .\nA : in that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality .\nB : so your you think we should go for more universal high-performance what do what do you think about what componen .\nA : we can't , with the price range .\nA : we we're not building universal remote , we're not building high end product .\nD : we have twelve point five euros per per r_c_ and with this now that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new new features .\nD : and but that's ye don't think is not necessary , for long term .\nA : if we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to screens and things like that which would drive the cost up lot .\nB : whether that's necessary .\nB : is the screen thi this could be this could be market because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive .\nA : for universal remotes if you .\nA : and quite complicated to use , yes .\nB : so we can try to go in between , and offer product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than normal r_c_ because it has more it it is in some kind universal .\nA : not as flexible , , but .\nA : but if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own t_v_s to use remote control on .\nB : yes but we're targeting on more on the on the twenty to forty group .\nB : who just have or already have job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on on universal universal control .\nA : really what the the price range for remote controls is .\nA : are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we middle to bottom ?\nB : when we over thi we are trying to offer the universal control for for less money .\nB : so do you agree ?\nC : it's fine with me like the price as long as it is not too expensive .\nD : because we have to take into account that we are gonna we are gonna sell four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers the price of chip is price of chip is very cheap .\nC : and it our provin .\nD : so i'm for designing ne less universal r_c_ .\nB : you t's possible for the twelve euro fifty ?\nB : so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal control .\nC : that's that's what we needed .\nC : that's needed now .\nC : and you can look to the standards of other actu .\nD : that's needed , .\nD : and if we want to get the market , we really need that .\nA : so what i'd like from universal remote is choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , v_c_r_ and t_v_ .\nA : and just be able to use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .\nC : you can also browse through all the standards , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .\nD : is that for you ?\nB : so given we are going for this universal type it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and you will try to get more specific user interface content and you can look on on what trends are in this in this type of market .\nB : so anyone has point to bring in or shall we no .\nC : don't have anything now .\nC : we can we'll we'll go and we'll i'm we'll up something good for the so we meet in what are our .\nD : that's that's fine then .\nB : yes , we we can have lunch now .\nB : so then the next meeting will after lunch you have we have thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting .\nB : but you will be informed via the computer .\nC : so see you later ."], ["<t> Then the project manager opens the meeting announcing that they will address conceptual design and then giving the agenda. </t>  <t> Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends. </t>  <t> She emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting, contain a cool feature, and be somewhat intuitive. </t>  <t> She reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors, bold designs, and a spongy feel is appropriate. </t>  <t> She lists ideas such as changable covers, a locator, speech recognition, and LCD screens. </t>  <t> The industrial specialist presents, talking about how a remote typically has different keys, structures and forms. </t>  <t> He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote. </t>  <t> They discuss without certainity about the cost of such functions. </t>  <t> The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process, listing options such as various buttons, scroll wheels, integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse, and LCDs.  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip. </t>  <t> They decide to make two designs, one more advanced than the other. </t>  <t> The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her tasks will be until the next meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will look for the cost inventories of other devices, such as speech recognition. </t>  <t> She will also start evaluating the team's work if possible. </t>  <t> The industial and interface designer will work together on the two prototypes (one cost-effective and one higher-end). </t>  <t> They will recieve further instructions by email. </t>  <t> They decide that the keys on the remote should be smooth, big, and there should not be too many. </t>  <t> They are not certain if the project budget will allow them to use the more expensive chip, so they decided to make two prototypes so that they can compare them and possibly find a compromise. </t> ", "A : first time this time .\nA : nu there we go .\nA : it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time .\nD : so we are just waiting for matthew .\nA : for matthew , .\nB : so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason .\nB : today we will talk about conceptual design .\nB : hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design .\nB : this will be the agenda for the meeting .\nB : will take some minutes again .\nB : we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented .\nB : so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this .\nB : so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ?\nA : have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation .\nD : the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good .\nB : there is matthew .\nB : do presentation ready ?\nA : i'm just emailing it to you .\nC : so sent you the slides , you didn't see them ?\nB : so did you manage yes see him , good yes .\nA : it should've gone through to you .\nB : yes have it .\nA : so this is just presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment .\nA : can put this on ?\nA : so we have to work out way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it .\nA : this is to do this will not remove my microphone .\nA : we used some focus group surveys which went through with you last time , the main results of that , and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment , and as part of this the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really .\nA : the most important by far was the look and feel of it .\nA : it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there .\nA : it needs to stand out .\nA : it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment .\nA : most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out .\nA : people will wanna buy it .\nA : that was twice as important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it .\nA : people have to then think about it and say got something there that want .\nA : that's really feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again .\nA : third on the list , innovative was twice as important as this last aspect , it has to be easy to use .\nA : so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it .\nA : drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , fruit and vegetables .\nA : this is talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , eye-catching , really bold designs , and spongy feel .\nA : had talk to the design people about this , but having remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really .\nA : that would make it stand out .\nD : so can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ?\nD : about the feeling yo .\nA : ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing .\nA : spongy is the current texture , but there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile , so if we make it like furry or soft , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .\nA : so as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers .\nA : so going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables .\nA : going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is .\nA : that's one way of looking at it .\nA : textured feel we just talked about .\nA : it's another way of doing that .\nA : so if it's part of the the changeable covers then may they can choose different texture , spongy one or soft one like that .\nA : so they can choose it li as they want to to to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .\nD : that's very good idea , .\nA : and , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks .\nA : also just the way that lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment .\nA : they're big selling items .\nA : people put lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas .\nA : back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still big issue .\nA : we talked about having way of finding remote control if it's been lost , that's one thing we could look at .\nA : there are other aspects like screens and speech recognition which weren't don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them .\nA : we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be really feature to put in .\nA : had no real specific ideas for this , we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top , by themselves , and then and then the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .\nB : yes matthew can can give some more information on the .\nA : and that's the presentation .\nB : good , that's very clear .\nA : so does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ?\nB : we yes can decide later on the the the look and feel of i've it was good idea to to yes the the the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce complete new line of of supplies it would be very complicated organisational .\nD : to let the people choose , you mean ?\nA : 're selling so many units of this .\nA : this is gonna be mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .\nD : range of , set of three , four different aspects .\nD : that fits the .\nB : yes and it will be we we get if it works we can get after-sales that would would be very good those covers could go for for three , five euro .\nB : that's very good idea and then we can go matthew's presentation because the together , because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , what you were already mentioning .\nC : then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together .\nC : it should be easier with that .\nD : and your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside .\nC : so i'll i'll go with that actually so so so then the the idea of having remote is generally you have different keys and different structures , different forms , and they could be like buttons or like and they could be of varying sizes if you want to to emphasize particular key more than the other , and like you can have different colours having the red for the on off switching on and off the button .\nC : so this this is the general trend to ha the method they do .\nC : so what have found was that currently the they are mostly that the t_v_ , v_c_r_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys if you want to follow the v_c_r_ and if you want to follow the some soundtrack on the see they have the common thing actually you can have and there is also speech recognition to store channel information , names , like you can if you have multiple functionality , say t_v_ , v_c_r_ say it to the t_v_ and the t_v_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information .\nA : like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the the name of channel like b_b_c_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad .\nC : so you you you can just because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to so it it it's like it limited one .\nA : that's good idea .\nA : really like that idea .\nD : so what functionalities do you suggest for that ?\nD : for facing this problem ?\nC : in the present market saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word .\nC : you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel .\nA : ten channels , at the most .\nC : some ten twelve channel information .\nC : you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that .\nC : and it depends like the remote with display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities you are watching movie , and you are having universal remote control and you want to you really which functionality is now , so am using the t_v_ so every time use it , it could be like , use simple toggle switch , and display , so press it so the display says , , i'm in t_v_ or d_v_d_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them .\nC : and there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them .\nC : so these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present .\nC : personally would look at things like having universal remote , is is good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition .\nC : got mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the speech recognition into into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi joe , like that , , and you you won't be using it , so it's limited vocabulary thing , and very isolated word and it's it is interesting , and storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and having something like blinking thing , like it could indicate you're it it could indicate what is cal like the whether you you have enough battery in your in your remote , the blinking .\nA : but coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's it's small vocabulary .\nC : at the same time , if it's dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or you can let them to do that .\nD : and you want for coming back to one point you want to let the user to programming the keys ?\nA : two thirty five supposed to finish .\nD : some of them ?\nD : and isn't that too difficult for the we want if we still want the r_c_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise .\nC : no but the if you give it depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .\nC : like would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint .\nA : you can do it both ways .\nC : so it de so so .\nA : you can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .\nB : yes but but do you can give hand to us because i'm not whether that that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents .\nB : i'm to have every time have to come down on this price again to so this might be little limiting for your creativity , but it's it's it's the real we have to consider it .\nB : so do we think these ideas an and my sp speech recognition , it's possible for for twelve euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the the the the furry case of the .\nD : like would say that for programming keys , you said , it could be easily done within the the package of twel twelve euros , but for the a_s_r_ system , i'm not if it's feasible to have this or we exactly if if it's low vocabulary it's already implemented , and how much it's cost , with cheap chip .\nC : we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can check how much how much they .\nC : we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , .\nC : and also you can think of having since you have something if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need some indicator , so it could be blinking option of l_e_d_ it could actually be used to detect also .\nC : if it's in dark room you can detect it also .\nC : so no actually if it is like it tells you , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , which is having which need just six six volt three volts of d_c_ .\nA : like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up .\nC : it may need more actually , so you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit .\nC : and then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your how much is the battery , that is good enough to even locate even if you want to .\nC : so you you have time some more ?\nD : how if if have time to talk about the .\nB : yes would yes yes you can you can still .\nB : we have time .\nD : so what i'm gonna present here is very basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside r_c_ remote control , and how is it manufactured what is the process , just to explain you .\nD : so the method is ther there is set of components in in remote control like , and what cost the the components in themself do not cost lot but the the way to assemble everything costs , and will show you my preferences at the end .\nD : so there are two different types of two different ways of using the the components for making remote control .\nD : the basic way is to use an integrated circuit and some transistors with an that aims at communicating the message and to to send the message to the to the led that will transmit to the receiver .\nD : and the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components .\nD : so you finding , just to say that the chip can detect when key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to sequence , something like morse code , as , with different sequence for each key , and that's , with the components we will use , we will have different messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger .\nD : so electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it's easier to mass produce and assemble .\nD : and so for our design we want some programmable v_ v_l_s_i_ or f_p_g_a_ high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use like in any high-tech devices chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them .\nD : so my personal design we need to find solution what what is the material of the cover we want to use .\nD : if it's plastic or you said that you had some ideas like fruit , veg or .\nB : ll we can give the the the case very normal very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .\nB : so like normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , , wooden case .\nA : just have just the veneer on it , .\nD : like they do in with cars .\nD : inside the car .\nD : so they also emailed me that they have available bunch of different buttons , scroll wheels , integrated push buttons such as computer mouse .\nD : and very cheap l_c_d_s , so liquid crystal displays , so i'm wondering , we might be able to integrate into our r_c_ .\nD : and the final point is we have there are some compromise to to do .\nD : so we have to know that the push button requires simple chip , but the scroll wheel and that higher high-tech needs more money which is higher price range alright .\nD : and the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but with twelve euros and if it's made for four million items , then we could be able to handle that .\nD : so to to sum up we need so said that the components the list of components has to be listed and and assembly is an important process that has to be taken into account .\nD : and for the designing of the cove cover layout then it's better to to to see that with the the u_r_ exp u_r_i_ expert so that we can it's really team-working .\nD : so not design something without your agreement , ?\nC : so wanted to know like if you want to have fo if you want to have the display over there , or if you want to store programmes with keys what things you'll need inside your thin inside wh what what .\nD : it's simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert .\nD : we could insert one that could underlie several functions of exactly , for customizing and .\nC : so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card .\nC : where they do all the wi with with them actually .\nC : how cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .\nB : so so we we should come to some decisions now about this .\nB : so understand when we want display we need expensive chip , but when we want scrolling wheel we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features .\nD : exactly that's very good idea , we could have one main chip that could handle , it's called f_p_g_a_ chip , that could handle both like scrolling wheels as as and .\nB : so when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .\nC : if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro .\nB : do you think that's feasible ?\nB : you you t's possible .\nC : is it possible to fit in to that ?\nD : also thinking , both if we had budget of twenty twenty euros , it will be , but .\nA : we need specific costings then .\nA : actually do two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .\nD : that's an excellent idea .\nB : yes wh when you make design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .\nB : that that would be very good idea .\nD : because now don't have price in in head but for next meeting i'm be able to do that .\nC : that's that's something which wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it .\nC : if if you want to put wood wouldn't suggest for wood 'cause it's it's much easier to use plastic or rubber rather than wood .\nD : agree on that .\nC : it will be much ch much expensive though it's the most natural thing , but .\nB : yes but we can just use more cheap plastic for basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with with another price .\nC : it's we we can give preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for .\nB : do do you agree ?\nD : but it's detailed plastic versus wood , and we need to centre our description on the the really the what buttons what functionality we want to offer to the user , and with graphs or user interface designer you could help us on that .\nB : ma for next meeting we you two can present real design .\nB : so drawing it on the board .\nB : and then we now sh only have to to decide the general function .\nB : so let let's say next meeting you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .\nB : furthermore we go for the for the basic plastic case which can be later fancied up with with addit additional , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put cover over it .\nB : but that that that that can be done later .\nB : we now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control .\nC : we can give them smooth keys , .\nC : smooth keys with bigger so that the the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if the if we if we go to different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together to you can actually , , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , and now you can , , as was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people .\nA : so is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas ?\nC : at the same time , it is more like it would be more interesting for people who are having this r_s_i_ and all problem .\nB : yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing .\nC : big keys may better for them actually and .\nD : agree , and not too too many keys .\nA : one i've had before , remote control we have at home is one that's actually got cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys .\nB : but then you have still have when you don't use it you have such an extent of your remote control which you don't use .\nB : so it's possible , whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you don't use that much .\nA : i've seen that before too .\nA : anoth another like it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath .\nC : so it's something like this , the model here you can put the keys .\nA : but i've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as .\nD : that's what you mean ?\nB : yes that's what so something like like book .\nA : like this one .\nA : like the shape of this one .\nA : can we have can we think about having non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box that's curved .\nD : like also this one .\nD : the point is we need to also to make decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like we should dec decide numbers or .\nC : we should make that next meeting we should be that would depend upon us actually .\nA : is this for the next meeting though ?\nA : we might be out of time out of time for this meeting .\nB : ju just make two designs , and the we we can decide decide between those designs .\nB : that would be good idea .\nB : so anyone any questions for now ?\nA : so is this is there anything else need to do from marketing point of view for the next meeting ?\nB : yes come to that yes , whether that's possible , you can start evaluating their work somehow .\nC : it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition like that .\nA : this me designing way to evaluate it so thinking about how to set up test groups and things ?\nB : whether that's possible in the given time but as far as possible .\nB : so you two will be together working on on two prototypes and further instructions will be will be sent to you by by email .\nD : two or three prototypes ?\nC : one for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or find compromise between both of them , that's how it is .\nD : and find compromise .\nB : let's call this to an end .\nC : so we are done for now ."], ["<t> As the meeting opens the project manager tells the group that they must stay within the budget of twelve Euro and fifty cents or will have to redesign. </t>  <t> After Matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes, beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 Euros to produce. </t>  <t> It contains an on-off button, volume switch, up/down channel function, 10 digits, and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function. </t>  <t> The next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone, has 6 keys, and is smooth. </t>  <t> It also has a power button, channel up/down, slow pause/slow stop, LCD screen, toggle switch that changes it from audio to video, and microphone. </t>  <t> It would cost 16 Euros to produce, which is out of the budget. </t>  <t> The marketing expert gives the product evaluation and they rate them on look and feel, innovation, ease of use, appeal to the correct demographic, and adherence to the company motto and fashion trends. </t>  <t> They discuss the energy source, shape, chip type, LCD and speech recognition, and additional buttons. </t>  <t> After choosing features their remote costs 12 Euros to produce. </t>  <t> They close the meeting by thanking one another. </t>  <t> NA. </t>  <t> The remote will be double-curved. </t>  <t> The energy source will be a normal AA battery. </t>  <t> Shaped like a surfboard. </t>  <t> Made of plastic. </t>  <t> Will contain a regular chip. </t>  <t> Have no LCD screen or speech recognition. </t>  <t> Addition of two buttons. </t>  <t> Production cost 12 Euros, 50 cents cheaper than budget. </t>  <t> Will talk to the suppliers to see if they can lower prices and add a few more features. </t>  <t> The group created two design prototypes to choose from. </t>  <t> When they rated both products, they found that the basic version was not innovative enough but the advanced version was too costly. </t>  <t> They eliminated many of the features of the advanced version, eventually bringing them near to the basic. </t>  <t> It was a long and tedious process, taking much time for them to reach an agreement since some felt an LCD screen was necessary and others did not. </t> ", "A : did you get my email with the slides ?\nC : have to change the pen otherwise .\nC : will be completely different .\nA : they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats .\nA : might be seat floor rather than person .\nA : put it back .\nC : and do you t's .\nA : jo's making faces at me .\nB : matthew is late again .\nB : probably an important man .\nB : so is important for him to be here .\nC : so what can you ?\nB : he he he you did work together didn't you ?\nC : we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer .\nC : we can put on the here .\nC : we we designed the two items .\nB : yes but we yes , we should phone him .\nC : can we have phone , can someone it's really designed .\nB : when he is not here we will just we just have to continue .\nB : so just for record will take notes again .\nB : and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents .\nB : it's he said to me when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign .\nB : there is no no negotiation possible in this matter .\nB : so we have to consider that .\nB : so anna , you can have your presentation .\nA : can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have design .\nB : you are here .\nB : ma then you can start now with presenting your your designs .\nC : so will start by the the basic one that fits into eight euros actually , , seven eight euros , and first for both they have special shape , the designer can explain better than me , but it's like surf board .\nC : and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf t_v_ , the web , and it's interesting shape because unconsciously people want to to surf when they see this .\nC : and also it's not too far from mobile .\nC : so people are used to that shape , .\nC : don't take care too much about the colour because we don't take .\nD : now we are supposed to give some oper offers now .\nC : so here would be the the the infrared led l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_ , the on-off button , in red .\nC : here would be the volume .\nC : on the on the left , , so easy to turn on and off .\nC : and so this is very cheap version so there are you can carry on matthew .\nD : also so you have browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , , if you have video you can forward , back .\nC : how can you change from v_c_r_ to t_v_ , by the way ?\nD : no no no , this is single this this is model with just the t_v_ one .\nD : no no just , this is standard t_v_ one , we are not talking about that .\nD : so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits .\nD : the extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel .\nD : and the other one is for the teletext you want to browse through from that .\nA : so it's it's very basic remote then , it's only .\nD : it's very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it and would cost us to build it about eight euros .\nC : seven , eight , ei eight euros .\nB : exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has quite conventional layout of buttons .\nD : so this one model and .\nA : like the volume control , that's good .\nD : this is magic one but know we don't want to talk about that , like it is very futuristic , it's like it's like brain machine interface and all this we are thinking about in the future , it can come .\nA : so it doesn't actually have buttons .\nD : so that then what we look .\nA : did you wanna see ?\nB : no you can carry on , look how it feels all .\nD : this is model , .\nB : yes it really feels like like like mobile phone .\nB : just i'm really want to talk to it .\nA : it won't talk back .\nB : so but but continue with your .\nD : so then the this is the more little smooth and it gives lot of functionality , in this way , so all we have you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here .\nD : and so they have more space actually and it's easy to use this and you have so this is standard infrared eye , and then you have power button , which volume , what you have , and then other than that you have channel up and down and slow pause or slow lo pause or stop , and then you can you have display , here and this is functional thing which can change like it's toggle switch which could change the function say , you press it .\nC : play , pause .\nB : from d_v_d_ player to television .\nD : really can change it , so instead of having many switches , the can display what is that on that , and you can have integrated microphone over here , or in the button here , so which can you want to do speech recognition and that channel lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the on your on your display .\nC : to audio and to video on demand .\nB : yes and and and then you get feedback via the .\nC : this is the orange button , the microphone .\nD : and here is small l_e_d_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as was talking earlier .\nD : and then we have cover , you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add tactile thing to this cover .\nC : crazy dis designer , .\nB : but but but but in there when this is closed , will it also cover up the screen ?\nD : it's to do that .\nB : but but the screen is very an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be that that's true .\nD : actually when you are watching the t_v_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , , you want to and this gives protection to the actually , giving cover to that actually .\nD : gives protection because when it falls down it it is it is is is it gives protec it's more robust that way .\nB : yes , more robust .\nD : and you have very good chances .\nC : it's low weight .\nC : you have to see the the components we put inside is very low weight .\nC : so the the cost is actually bit more , it's it's it's sixteen francs .\nD : it sixteen euros .\nA : so it's outside the budget then .\nC : then it's out of budget .\nC : but the the main point we we talk about that with our manufacturer .\nC : and they say that the s_r_ system would be something like three francs per item so three euros .\nC : and no no no , part of that , .\nA : that's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ?\nD : part of that .\nA : so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition .\nD : if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more some more keys if you want to it it should not be cluttering up everything .\nC : we should stick with number of keys because if we add too much then it's too locati .\nA : what's this one on the side ?\nD : that's for the it's l_e_d_ for indicating your battery and as as it's like blinking one you can keep it aside .\nA : like the shape of them , do like the the size and the the shape .\nB : be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , anna you can give our give us your yes .\nA : and we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two .\nB : evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at .\nA : this is what we've talked about already , , from the marketing point of view .\nA : we just wanna make that we've taken into account .\nB : just do it quickly if if we al already .\nA : so it's just shortlist of criteria on the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product .\nA : we just go through these and rate them as group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so these are the things we identified as being important .\nA : the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the way to appeal to our demographic .\nA : and then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as .\nA : so do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ?\nB : no why not why not discuss discuss it now , , my my personal view is when when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it .\nA : so just go through onto the whiteboard .\nA : not how this is gonna come out .\nA : so the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ?\nA : 'cause if we're only going to make it for eight euros then we have .\nB : and then you must just see it we can still spend this four and half euro and to because the the selling price is already prite fik quite fixed on twenty five euros so we just have to offer as much as as value for the for the customer he can have for twenty five euro .\nA : so look and feel , innovation .\nD : and now it easy to use .\nC : easy to use .\nA : you following the idea of using the removable covers on these ?\nA : is that part of both of them or ?\nB : we can still discuss that .\nB : so , and together with evaluating this we we might come with new ideas adding things or removing of options because they are too expensive , but i've received framework which we can do this .\nB : did you have this this excel sheet ?\nB : no , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production production unit for several components , so we can see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro fifty cents .\nB : so we can start with this , , calling this one .\nA : so it's the pink .\nB : this is the first design .\nA : and the other one's green .\nA : so look and feel ?\nA : where one is i've broken the pen again .\nB : there is another pen .\nA : get that one .\nA : one's bad and seven's the best .\nA : one's true and seven's false .\nA : one's the best .\nA : so on scale of one to seven ?\nB : look and feel .\nB : you already feel that .\nB : in in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so would consider two or or may even one for feel .\nB : but that's just half , we should also consider look , and then it looks quite conventional .\nB : don't you agree ?\nA : on the scale it's between functional and fancy we're looking at , so .\nB : ma ma ma ma say say five it's my opinion , but what what four , four .\nD : will give it we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say .\nD : it though the look is fine but still will give four in that case .\nB : now we then we settle on four .\nB : can you fix the other , try it , just try it .\nC : if you press like this not like this then you but .\nA : no that's the ink's dried .\nD : can you get the batteries ?\nD : no no the battery has fallen down , that's .\nA : battery's low , isn't it the ink ?\nA : the that's the that that one ?\nD : no no it's not that , it's how to close battery .\nD : now it should be .\nA : no it's lost battery .\nA : no it's it would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors .\nB : it will not ri , .\nD : is there another battery there ?\nA : you got second ?\nA : won't be able to tell .\nB : yes , it it has .\nA : is that working ?\nA : did it come out ?\nA : because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard .\nB : so then then .\nA : and the other one ?\nA : it's slightly better , , it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , but .\nB : when we want to include i'm doubting about this this component .\nB : it it it it breaks in your , yes see , .\nC : it's not button it's led , it's ac actually it should be embedded .\nD : no actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , it it's it is jus it's led actually which which 'll be covering in curve it's will be embedded there so it won't be really protruding .\nC : you can push push it again , you can push it .\nA : the other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ?\nA : 'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , it won't work so .\nD : no you it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that it's fine .\nA : i'd say two or three for that one , personally .\nA : probably more towards three than two .\nB : the look is better but the feel is is is worse .\nB : so so would also say this is four .\nB : but do you what do you think ?\nD : my just that the feel is that you now you you don't see the feel because if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one .\nD : this is how embedded one will .\nB : yes , it is the same shape .\nD : it's bas the same thing actually .\nD : you will be except that in this .\nC : and the makes it better .\nD : and you might have slight thing for to forward and , .\nC : so will say two .\nA : it's it's definitely more fancier than that one .\nC : would say two , three .\nA : so , consensus ?\nA : two or three ?\nB : two's good yes .\nD : looking like no but except for the design of the surf .\nA : the first one , not really muc .\nC : there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , ?\nC : the surf design .\nA : what what features are we actually including ?\nD : you should be rea no it's more of the feel .\nA : are we including like location thing like trying to find it ?\nA : there's nothing like that ?\nA : but is there any there's no actual innovation in that , it's just straight-out remote control .\nB : the only innova innovation is the shape .\nD : say about that .\nA : so there's no this look and feel thing , though that's not technological innovation .\nA : so i'd be up for seven for innovation .\nC : and the and the second one is really state of the art , in terms of innovation .\nC : and with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part .\nD : it gives it .\nB : and the screen is that's that's that's t's quite innovative .\nC : and all the scrolling buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this .\nC : could put it at one or two would say .\nA : so what is it , what are the innovations with this ?\nA : got the screen .\nC : automatic speech recognition .\nA : is that in this one though ?\nA : is this 'cause this is the there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget .\nD : no , we ha , eight euros .\nB : we just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget .\nA : so the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one ?\nC : actually we have to check again .\nA : and this one was sixteen euros .\nA : innovation for this one is two ?\nD : it's two , would say two .\nC : un to be one what would do we nee actually , , don't see , one would would be without buttons , .\nB : why it is one .\nA : the speech recognition is very good innovation believe it , so give it one ?\nC : so we can put one .\nB : this this is it with the speech recognition ?\nC : it's using speech recognition , .\nB : gi given that that it works , then it's one .\nA : ease of use ?\nD : he is used to it act they are used to it actually .\nC : so the first one is really standard , so everybody including our grandmothers can use it , ?\nA : so that's two for ease of use .\nD : here there may , though it has more functionality it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually .\nC : the other one is quite easy , tho though .\nD : it shouldn't be diffi , actually it will be but have reduced the keys actually you see .\nA : so three or four .\nC : one me we hope sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons .\nC : and there is like would say three .\nA : three or four ?\nB : three , would .\nD : three is fine with me .\nC : because it's it's not like big one with one hundred buttons or so , this one would be for grandmothers .\nD : it's actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , it's not so easy , like this one the normal .\nB : yes but then when when he is used to it , it is quite easy .\nD : is quite easy .\nB : so so three is good .\nD : initially there there is lot of effort , .\nB : what's the next ?\nA : so three's how goes to the target demographic .\nA : so we're we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ?\nB : so twe twenty to forty , yes that's .\nD : no , this would would would give this model to the old people actually .\nA : so sh completely changed our demographic there , it's not part of the the funky young thing .\nB : exce except for the surfing shape .\nB : that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group , but we after this we can can consider , making this more attractive to to the demographic .\nA : if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then imagine it being applying to the the demographic .\nA : that's it's still ye .\nA : 'cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add few things to it , .\nB : but as it is now , would say , six , something .\nB : do you agree ?\nC : because it's so important it's it was written that it really so important , the the the look and taking care of its it targets , the range of people , ?\nD : but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually .\nA : but it's going to be cheap whatever though , it was set with we've got set price .\nD : so and people can still decide to use the cheaper one instead of .\nC : but for us it's we have constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros .\nA : there's nothing that would make me spend an extra few euros on that one rather than another one .\nB : ju just think , twenty five euros , it's not going to be cheaper .\nD : so in that case t's fine then .\nA : and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ?\nD : and the demographics of it's it has more market actually .\nA : it's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the screen and .\nB : tha tha tha tha tha that's it's better , because of the screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the .\nC : and if you want to target if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , for this audience we need the screen .\nB : so , the screen attracts , yes .\nB : because it , ma that's something to consider , yes , so .\nA : especially if we're gonna have an screen on low range product then that's good .\nB : wh what what no say two .\nA : i'd probably go with three again for that one .\nC : or even even one and two .\nA : so , two , ?\nD : because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that .\nD : because then you you have it you have lot of things which you can include for the people to we have to practically test it .\nA : and especially 'cause this has the speech recognition as , and that makes it more appealing , it's more of new fun toy .\nD : the field test will tell you how good .\nB : the final point , trends .\nA : and following the trends .\nA : so the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel .\nA : so as it is , not really doing either of them .\nC : spongy , , that means that it goes in in the water .\nA : the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as , know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but i'm thinking one of the nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy .\nC : but this one includes this feature , ?\nD : we we we we we , it's the way they are going to be , actually .\nA : so it's , .\nC : so the in the colour we can make it fruit and and veggie .\nA : but that's if you're using the covers .\nB : and the then we can al yes .\nA : or is it just one they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated .\nB : we can we can consider is it possible do you think , to to make cover for such phone ?\nB : just with the with the flexible plastic or just two things which can be put on each other .\nD : but why do you want to cover that actually ?\nD : in that in the mod are you ?\nA : so you got the option of having different colours or different textures .\nC : this is possible .\nD : it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , .\nC : exactly like nokia phones .\nB : yes , exactly like it .\nB : so we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy look of vegetables , to to these covers and now try to invest in the in in the features .\nA : the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion .\nC : 'cause sometimes look at this computer , this laptop , it's all black , and it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here .\nC : so we could do like in the range the set of what we propose black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of such people that want really standard things .\nA : and then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers .\nB : so so so that that would make the trends equal , so we we we really have don't have , .\nA : 'cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them .\nA : although it is more with the spongy buttons on the on the other one .\nC : so point better for the for the number two .\nA : two and three , or one and two ?\nB : say , say one and two .\nB : one and two .\nB : so le le let's see .\nB : so this one has spongy but buttons ?\nD : it says one point six , one point one point eight .\nC : the blue one spongy .\nB : see , yes .\nA : so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five nine by five , one point eight ?\nB : just add it .\nB : three , six , seven .\nA : this one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two .\nD : four point four point two .\nA : but we still got very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway .\nB : we we must try to get them closer .\nB : both in or we just have to choose .\nB : because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and when we to for this one we have to make it more cheap .\nA : t's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out .\nA : that'll take us down to the budget .\nB : yes , but i'm now did did you work with the same prices that have here ?\nC : so give give call with the manufacturer and explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen fr euros .\nC : unfortunately we didn't see this chip , matthew , so we have to recap with this one .\nB : tha yes , re reconsider it .\nD : we ought to reconsider everything with this , .\nB : so let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , what energy source we didn't speak about that .\nB : it's it's normal battery , or yes .\nD : it migh it it'll need more than conventional one , it won't be just you might use a_a_ battery actually .\nD : what do you say , mael ?\nC : for this one it's normal battery .\nB : just so one battery .\nB : given speech recognition you should go for the less fancy chip .\nC : sample speaker , .\nB : yes , or sample sensor , yes .\nC : sample , , this one .\nB : yes , this one .\nB : see double curve .\nC : so so which one are we talking to ?\nD : it's are you talking about this or that ?\nA : it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely .\nA : either of them .\nB : yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu so this would be double curves ?\nA : they're both going to be not basic cases .\nB : plastic would be the material .\nA : the basic one , .\nC : is it zero franc ?\nB : special colour , now we leave it to the covers .\nA : so now we're either going button or l_c_d_s , display .\nB : yes , but now this is per per unit , this number of components .\nA : is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ?\nA : so it would need twelve buttons .\nD : we might need scroll wheel , , for that ?\nC : no but for this one it's twelve euro .\nD : no , for that one also .\nC : there are twelve ?\nB : so , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , yes .\nB : so this comes to eighteen .\nA : and that's without any special button supplements .\nD : one scroll wheel you might need .\nB : so so but do you agree that thi yes yes i'm i'm no i'm no i'm not sh .\nA : so we'd have special colour , special form and special material on all of them .\nA : they're not just standard buttons .\nD : bad estimate , ?\nC : minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , ?\nC : because it's there is no like .\nA : but it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as , that's what .\nC : t's this curve like this so , it's there is only is is is there is nothing like in the other there are concave .\nB : yes kno undes understand what you mean , yes .\nA : you talking about concave curves ?\nC : so we can put the single curved in the sixteen .\nA : you think single curved ?\nC : that makes seventeen .\nC : and what are just the bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you ?\nB : we have we haven't talk about , but that's no is very exp inexpensive believe but it is not in the list .\nA : we have more , we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and the sc .\nC : so had bad bad estimation .\nA : we've got scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there .\nB : ho is this scroll wheel or is this button which can be pressed on two sides so for higher and lower ?\nC : no no no .\nA : we've only got five minutes left so we need to wrap it up pretty fast .\nC : yes , scroll wheel .\nA : so this is even more than the than the cost you gave , the sixteen euros .\nC : so based on that , , where is the es sample speaker but still , it no we cannot , .\nD : that is the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nB : so we're we we could go for the for the for the for the for simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ?\nD : we just need that actually .\nD : we need one .\nB : so so when we this would this would be cutting the speech recognition .\nC : so but the but if you have the near the you can choose select between like uni universal between audio , t_v_ and v_c_r_ , and this needs needs advanced chip .\nD : it it's going to be it's with the regular chip , .\nB : transti say say it's regular , regular chip , and we still on fifteen , so yes but that can just say one .\nC : or regular chip ?\nC : regular , today we you can do that with regular chip .\nC : and what about the number of buttons buttons my matthew ?\nC : when you look at this , this item , but you cannot make phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low , no ?\nB : ca we are just when we just want to to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty .\nB : so is it possible ?\nA : but that's seven basic buttons , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .\nD : that'll be then we have have to ask the user to press it several times .\nB : no no , he he he .\nA : so the display is is three francs , three euros , by itself .\nC : and we don't want to to change that ?\nC : we we really want other otherwise we wouldn not get the market .\nD : or we could even replace them by buttons actually .\nB : otherwise you ha you have ve very normal thing like this .\nA : so twelve euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an dispra display , that's seven fifty , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons .\nC : and so wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the , do you t's important ?\nA : and the chip .\nA : the chip's up there already .\nA : so we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that .\nC : because sometimes whe when you watch the t_v_ , you have big display and you don't need one more in your hands ?\nC : i'm just asking .\nD : actually it depends , it depends what functionalities you want to add into it , if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least .\nA : unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the display .\nD : so we can get rid of it and then add couple of buttons .\nC : but , do we want that ?\nC : on the market point of view , .\nC : what do you think , is major feature , or ?\nB : we have to come to decision now , just we we what we just do is vote about the the display so yes .\nA : for the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the display , there's no way we can get it in there .\nC : you assume , you want democratic voyt vote , ?\nB : one man one vote .\nB : so who thinks the the disply display should be should be in it ?\nA : i'd like it to be in but 't see it happening .\nA : 't see it fitting in .\nD : but but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that .\nC : we need to be .\nA : bu you're power voter veto anyway as project manager .\nB : know , but yes .\nA : have to make decision now , that's it .\nB : so having an display is just have very very limited amount of buttons .\nB : is that acceptable ?\nB : ca can have can the functions be implement in an you've you you agree .\nB : so hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve .\nB : so that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons .\nC : because one show me that actually we could we move these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here .\nC : here one , at the middle , and at the bottom .\nA : then we we're really losing ease of use .\nD : that will create another problem .\nD : for the people to use it .\nD : it's not going to be easy .\nB : so we should we should cut the screen .\nB : that that's that's my opinion .\nD : no , it's , you cut the screen and introduce two more buttons .\nB : just where , l_c_ we now we can just yes .\nA : so l_c_d_'s out , is speech rec out now ?\nC : the speech recognition is out .\nC : because of the budget , .\nA : so are we back to the original one now , back to the first version ?\nA : which turns out to be on budget exactly , .\nA : with these new costings .\nA : so just look at forget that one and look at that one now .\nB : we just go for this one and that that now twelve euros is the is is the price , .\nB : my my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected .\nC : actually , we we we will not need the really expert designers because the amount , .\nA : so we can go back and talk to the suppliers and see if we can drive the prices down to add few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .\nB : then we the same .\nB : that was it ."], ["<t> The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project. </t>  <t> The

many cables and .\nA : so welcome everyone .\nA : so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control .\nA : so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .\nA : and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .\nB : just one thing .\nB : you said twenty-five minutes , but have something else to do , so gotta have another meeting soon , so you could hurry up bit it's true .\nB : have another meeting so if you could .\nA : you have another meeting soon ?\nA : so you have to be quick .\nB : for the lawnmower project .\nA : so the the goal is to have remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .\nA : so the design step will be divided in three main points .\nA : first it will be the functional design .\nA : third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design .\nA : so the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .\nA : and then we will move to conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and like that .\nA : and then the desired devi design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point .\nA : so will now ask you which is very important for the design of new remote control for to each of us to to draw your favourite animal on the white board .\nB : what an original idea .\nA : do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ?\nC : no no you should write the name .\nA : you should if you want to react about this wonderful drawing i'll let you comment .\nB : can give you the no ?\nB : but don't have to say anything .\nB : when i'm drawing the orangutan .\nB : it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan .\nA : it's an abstract drawing .\nA : it's and original .\nB : don't have red colour .\nB : usually orangutans have red hair so this is very important but don't have red pen , so yes .\nA : you want to draw something christine ?\nD : you have to imagine little bit .\nA : your animal is recorded so it's not lost .\nA : is this it's pretty .\nB : wha what is this strange beast ?\nD : is it beautiful ?\nB : is it monster ?\nB : these things did not exist .\nD : yes yes is it like that .\nD : is it better ?\nB : does have name ?\nD : it's my cat .\nA : it's your cat .\nD : the name is caramel .\nA : olivier , do you want to go , but next time you'll do something i'm .\nC : and you i'm too short for the cables .\nB : next time concentrate .\nA : i'm bit short on cable .\nA : so what could draw ?\nA : draw like very simplified cow .\nA : if it looks like cow like what ?\nB : he looks like bong .\nA : it it looks more like donkey would say .\nB : we will be finished this is it for for putting for logos , no .\nA : so hope that it helps you in the process of designing remote control .\nB : that's is there matter for new remote control ?\nA : let's move on .\nA : so here the financial objective of our project .\nA : that is to say to to have production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have selling price of twice that price in order to target profe profit of fifty million euros .\nA : if it's trendy , original fulfil the user needs .\nB : is it single device remote control or is it multi-device remote control ?\nA : we have to discuss that point .\nB : this is not defined ?\nA : on you you can suggest points like this .\nA : so what what so we have to decide if it can control one device or multiple .\nA : so what's what are your ideas about that ?\nA : have the your opinion from the marketing side ?\nB : do we sell other ?\nB : if if we bundle the remote control with something to sell then it could be single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy remote control from us .\nA : so if it selled by its own it it would rather be for multiple device .\nA : do you agree ?\nA : so it should be for multiple devices .\nA : and do you have any ideas of design ideas or any technical requirement we we should fulfil ?\nC : we shouldn't have too many for my part .\nB : no , couldn not of any requirements now .\nC : if we don't have so many buttons could be .\nA : and do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ?\nA : might be good idea .\nA : and do you have any any idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it shouldn't it should look like , or things like that ?\nC : something which is not squarey , not box .\nB : something like that , least fits in your hand .\nB : the basic requirement .\nA : fit in your hand , .\nA : and also it have , it may be it may be important for the remote control to be to , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall .\nC : and we should have device .\nA : it is original because you can use it in your in your bath whereas the others can't .\nA : water-proof would be very original .\nA : havin having water-proof remote control so that the people can use it in their bath .\nA : that could be but , it is still something you have to buy and that is not very , mayb but we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof as .\nB : it seems so , but if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can and , and that's one of the that's one of the shock there are people that have remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .\nB : that's people they actually do it themselves .\nB : it will look bulky in that case .\nA : we can sell all that together , so so plastic protection and and waterproof box as .\nA : that might be good track to follow .\nB : like as an optional thing .\nA : optional or selled with it ?\nC : and we should have something , most of the time lose my remote control .\nC : we should have special bu button on the t_v_ to make the remote control beeping .\nA : we can have but we don't design the t_v_ .\nA : we can have something you whistle and the remote control beep .\nA : so we can have whistle remote control ?\nA : whistle tracking remote control .\nA : that's good idea , that's very original and that's can improve .\nB : that's that's quite , but we you don't normally need any audio recording on your remote control ?\nB : so it's just going to add to the cost .\nA : but still we have to we have to have an advantage over our competitors .\nA : this is good advantage .\nB : like the idea , but i'm not about the what you , who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget .\nA : we have to ask .\nA : we have to ask the quest of that's design to the industrial designer .\nA : which is you .\nA : so try to find that for next meeting .\nA : so next meeting is in thirty minutes or so .\nA : so so will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed .\nA : so then will ask the user interf interface designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .\nA : and also will ask the market expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is needed in remote control for the user .\nA : and then will just ask you to think about that and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon .\nA : that's all for this point .\nB : so we come back in five minutes ?\nB : half an hour .\nA : anyway you will receive some messages .\nA : you eat it ?\nA : does it move ?\nA : but if it is still correctly we'll see ."], ["<t> The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design, dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use. </t>  <t> She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs, shock protection, voice recognition, and LCD screens. </t>  <t> The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group, that the remote is only to control televisions. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip, instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition, would be the most feasible. </t>  <t> The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. </t>  <t> The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints. </t>  <t> The group decided to include a previous channel change button to the standard remote buttons, and to have a wheel for changing channels in increments, with a smaller number pad below it. </t>  <t> The remote will not have an LCD screen. </t>  <t> The remote will not include speech recognition. </t>  <t> The group experienced many technical difficulties with their presentations; all participants encountered problems when opening their presentations. </t> ", "A : so we are here for for functional design .\nA : so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design .\nA : then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board .\nA : then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting .\nA : of the of the process .\nA : so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ?\nC : do you want to start ?\nA : you can start .\nB : cable , camera .\nA : you have powerpoint ?\nB : should be in my in their folder no ?\nA : who are you ?\nA : and we have technical problem .\nB : do we think in the in the wrong folder ?\nB : it is possible .\nA : you put it on .\nB : it was somewhere in something like this .\nB : don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami .\nC : what do you have in short cut ?\nA : you have no over .\nB : there is nothing .\nA : there's no we have technical problem .\nB : let's go and check .\nB : i'll go and check .\nC : otherwise , could you just describe by hand ?\nC : with the the whiteboard ?\nA : if you remember but that's .\nB : what we want here is remote control .\nB : so the question first of all what to control .\nB : so most people want to have remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and like that .\nB : and but other people want also remotes for controlling and toys like robotic pets and little robots and and other people also want to have remotes for controlling whole house .\nB : so there's project called x_ house like that that does that , you can integrate your remote with computers .\nB : so there is one that is one thing .\nB : the other is the the finder feature by whistling or whatever .\nB : if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want .\nB : so it should be package in that case .\nB : so the user interface will consist of two parts .\nB : one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part .\nB : and the buttons part would be set of buttons for choosing devices , set of buttons for special navigation in space , set of buttons for linear access of medium and set of buttons for random access .\nC : what do you mean by linear access then ?\nB : like video tape goes forward , backwards , fast and .\nA : so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's fourth one no ?\nA : so the better now for special navigation ?\nB : for special navigation you might have t_v_ in the menu and you going to change ?\nA : then linear access then random access .\nB : and also parameter changing .\nB : so if there are common parameters we should put special buttons for that or we could have everything generic but there are lot of remotes on the market now and this is most of the almost everybody has this .\nA : and and voice command did you .\nB : voice command we could specify anything .\nB : we could assign any button command to any button , if we have enough processing power , so .\nA : so that's that close your investigations ?\nB : not so far .\nA : we can have look at the user requirements with if open it .\nD : if you can open the is not here .\nA : you can it's messenger no ?\nA : in which folder ?\nB : where did you put it ?\nA : short-cut to ami shared folder ?\nD : but it's not .\nA : you can send it to me by email .\nA : just to participant one .\nA : will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable .\nA : you send it ?\nD : it's participant one ?\nA : this is this email .\nB : i'm designing the user interface .\nA : so switch slides when you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient .\nA : so , functional requirements .\nD : so you can you can go .\nD : so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled questionnaire ?\nD : and here have the results so you can see that seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more , more kind .\nD : eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy .\nD : eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look to it's not good .\nD : so it's not in theory but say .\nA : we can just keep doing that ?\nD : fifty seventy five per cent of users say they zap lot .\nD : so we have to have remote control very out for that .\nD : the buttons have are to be like you say resist resisting to to shocks .\nD : and fifty per cents of users say they only use ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control .\nD : so all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have use real use and not only or .\nA : so fewer buttons would be good ?\nD : not many buttons , and and useable buttons .\nB : but what remote controls did you look at ?\nB : what task was it ?\nB : it was t_v_ ?\nD : most for most is t_v_ .\nA : but we it it seems that we are going to make t_v_ remote control according to new requirements received from the management bo will present them in the following .\nD : you can go so .\nD : so there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said they lost often the remote control in in the room so they want to have way to to to find it .\nA : to find it .\nD : and lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control .\nD : so they want something really very simple and easy to use .\nD : and remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .\nA : what is her other side ?\nB : other side , yo wa your wrist .\nB : it become painful you can have tendonditis .\nA : did not knew that .\nB : if you also up on computer in strange position .\nA : so you we have to make it more ergonomic .\nB : have to say ha ha .\nA : it's your job .\nA : got message from microsoft .\nD : before that have some some some thing to say before we know that the user use lot their remote control to to change channel .\nD : and to to change volume selection of the and and not lot for setting for setting the the channels and thing things like that .\nD : so it's better to put something very easy to set and and very accessible yes .\nA : this function should be very accessible .\nA : this is the main function .\nD : so then we asked some questions to them and we asked this question if they prefer an screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions .\nB : the first question .\nD : so that for the younger it's very important to have the yes and speech recognition .\nA : to have and voice .\nD : and and the others is not so important but we know that people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch lot t_v_ and who who wh can use lot this .\nD : so we we can have speech recognition in .\nA : this this is important .\nA : moreover those like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view or so .\nD : and if there is the conclusion now .\nD : so as we say before , remote control lightening in the dark it's it's good thing .\nD : not to many mud buttons like we we said before , easy to use way to find it easily in the room and resistant to to shock and to to an no , .\nA : these are the user requi .\nD : if you see something else important or .\nC : i'm just thinking of some thing .\nC : we want to have no , if this is good idea .\nC : we want to have general remote control for everything .\nA : no no no .\nA : we it seems that we no want to have t_v_ remote control .\nA : from the management board receive an email .\nA : cos it would be costly and and also it it would take more time to develop to have general generic remote control .\nB : it's not true .\nB : the the second claim that you put .\nA : that it would be too long to develop .\nB : that should be the same .\nA : because received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should focus on t_v_ more where it seems that the market is more important .\nA : so it's good decision .\nA : what's your opinion ?\nB : have i've no idea should know bit more about how fast we can design it .\nC : but continue with my presentation , it would be al you you but we have some technical problem or so .\nC : so i'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control .\nA : you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do .\nC : if fact but do have .\nC : now have enough cables .\nB : like you feel bit like dog with this .\nC : so i'm just going to describe for for remote control this is quite easy .\nC : we just have , i'm going like that .\nC : i'm just going to describe .\nC : we have battery power supply here .\nC : after that we just have user interface .\nC : let's say that something like that , which could be let's say or an array of push button , something like that .\nC : push button or .\nC : after that we we feed that into an electronic chip .\nC : so say u_c_ and feed that to l_e_d_ which is infrared which is an infrared component .\nC : and so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy .\nA : u_c_ is the central unit ?\nC : it's it's this just chip which does all the numerical numerical computation according to your display .\nC : and so for us this is quite easy .\nC : we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface wants something and after that we just do the coding to and send that to to to the not the to the television .\nC : so for us this is quite easy .\nA : so this is quite easy .\nC : we just have to define the processing power that we need especially if we want to do some speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple .\nA : there is not that much constraints .\nB : this will think this will take more time to develop also .\nC : and but for standard one this is really easy .\nC : it's question of one month and so on no no no no , say standard standard remote control takes one month to to do that .\nA : to have you you speak about with voi voice control ?\nA : standard button one .\nB : so the only time problem is the sp voice recognition .\nA : so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?\nC : would say about eight months to have the first results .\nA : so it's bit long .\nA : one month for the standard one with button .\nA : even if we have display ?\nC : that this is really standard devices now .\nC : for speech recognition .\nA : so we can take this into account .\nA : so who would be good to go for like speech recognition ?\nB : but we don't have time to market .\nC : and also how much during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have but how many .\nB : we should contact management .\nA : each unit is is sell twenty five euros .\nB : how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units no , one hundred thousand units .\nB : we're gonna need chips .\nB : how much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?\nC : usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .\nA : because we are it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting .\nB : so you have any idea for powerful one that has good enough for do speech recognition .\nB : no it doesn't .\nA : we can we can look at the new requirement receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .\nC : had question do you want to continue with your presenta ?\nC : is it you say that don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control .\nA : ask your question if you want .\nC : do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ?\nC : to to to keep in mind to access to that menu you should do something like that .\nD : would they they say that it's difficult to learn how to use it but when how to use it , it's it's .\nC : and but and what about if we design remote control which can be configure as you want ?\nA : it's not intuitive first .\nC : you say that want , have six button .\nB : lot of people are if you have the screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure imagine so it's really something for the expert user .\nA : but , but also it seems that .\nB : so there are markets and markets .\nB : the young people are are christine here said you have it is .\nB : so for our young people it will be , they can be able to use it .\nB : their parents will not but they will configure it .\nB : if there is study about that .\nA : it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating simple product .\nB : and there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else .\nB : otherwise , if it's different then everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first .\nA : but also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons .\nA : so we may just make very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and also some lightning too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control .\nA : losed lose it etcetera .\nA : these these are these two points are the main frustrations so if we design something very simple and easy to find when lost it will add serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop .\nA : so but le let us see first the new requirement .\nA : so we don't have to so this this is is in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make very complex remote controls to access teletext and like that but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and .\nB : but teletext is just one button .\nB : you you just write the write the numbers .\nB : so will you add with the channel keys , ?\nA : so anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , they prefer to .\nB : i'm that it don't like but don't see just one button .\nA : if one button is still one more button .\nA : if if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to to our competitors .\nA : anyway have this point .\nA : we can discuss .\nA : also so as as told before it would be better if it's only for the t_v_ because we want to be quick on on the market .\nA : and then also we have to make very clear that this this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate logo and and colours on the on the design as so that they identify it as one of our product .\nA : so this is the the key point .\nA : so before finishing we can define what would be the characteristic of the of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .\nA : so do you so so from from the the marketing expert key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so we have to do something very simple and we all agree on that point , no ?\nB : it is going to be just t_v_ remote control it is going to be very simple .\nA : so the key point here is simple .\nA : so few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ?\nB : it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that see really .\nA : switch t_v_ on and off .\nB : no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us .\nA : volume , mute button , and then on off button .\nA : and that's all ?\nC : know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of lot of zapping .\nC : know tha discovered that when did quick look , they do now som they do something which is quite now , you have button , you you press it , and this is the previous channel which has come back .\nB : it's memory , .\nA : we can include that also .\nA : previous previous channel button .\nA : so we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus mute button , and just the the traditional on off button .\nB : and and the channel changing buttons .\nA : talk about that , ?\nB : how should they how should we implement that ?\nB : because could be numerical only or could be also incremental .\nA : incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them .\nC : let's say that we can do something like that .\nC : this is incremental , but once you press it for long time , you go five by five .\nA : we go faster ?\nC : to go fa to go faster .\nB : it's an interesting idea , that if you press it for long time it does something else , in general .\nB : so if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for long time no .\nB : doesn't work does it .\nA : we should have also digit button .\nB : we should have complete keyboard and just type console commands .\nB : change channel to eight .\nA : we have also to have digits or only incremental .\nA : bec because if you have the .\nB : it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels then you you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental .\nA : because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one .\nA : so we need also digits .\nA : we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits .\nB : when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and .\nC : or we can do something like that .\nC : we can design the remote control to have access .\nC : some remote control have protection and so you you you , joystick .\nB : thought this thing there is there is are some with wheel like this .\nB : instead of having the up down buttons for you can have the wheel .\nA : we can have wheel for incremental .\nA : so have wheel for incremental , have the digits on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , and this is the basi and do we do we have no , wheel is better .\nB : on the lower side it you have to turn it .\nB : if we do that .\nC : or or ball , , not wheel but ball , and you say to .\nA : would say the wheel is better .\nB : because of that because it's it's it's not like volume which is smooth ?\nA : what is the expert of .\nB : the channels change one by one .\nB : so you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense bit .\nA : that's good idea .\nA : also we have to decide so it should be lightening in the dark because most people lost their remote control .\nC : 's quite it's quite easy we do that with back light on the on the wheel .\nB : even if l_e_d_ or if if it's the feature whatever , .\nC : blue blue l_e_d_ and we sell that .\nA : and do we put an display ?\nA : because it was important for young customers if you remember .\nB : it's only put on if cou have multi function .\nB : if you do not multi function then there is no point in having .\nB : just increase the cost .\nB : the user does not have an advantage really .\nA : and so no speech as because it it would delay too much the development process .\nB : it's going to delay but it will be .\nB : because user could say c_n_n_ and it would go c_n_n_ .\nA : that would be .\nA : but eight months is really long and we can just .\nA : so will will so we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break here are the individual action you are required to do but you will be recalled to the actions by email but you can take notes if you if you want but the instruction will be sent .\nA : so for your suggestion and will make summary of that meeting that will put in the shared folder you can't see and and then you will you will be able to to see what has been has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided .\nA : for next meeting send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them altogether .\nA : that would be easier .\nB : what is the folder that you put yours in ?\nB : and did it it did work ?\nA : no it did not work .\nA : she send it to me by email .\nA : so this is better , to send it by email .\nB : what is your email ?\nA : so i'm it's in the first email so i'm participant one at ami where is that , it's here .\nB : at participant one .\nA : participant one at ami .\nA : so see you after lunch break .\nB : during lunch break actually .\nB : so next time we should have fight .\nB : how about management .\nB : who happens to be your friend ."], ["<t> The Industrial Designer presented the

banana, and be covered in a spongy material. </t>  <t> The buttons will be lighted. </t>  <t> The group decided to keep the wheel sensor despite the added cost. </t>  <t> It will be placed at the top of the banana shape. </t>  <t> The group decided to simply use a standard chip that will not accomodate speech recognition, as this feature will be eliminated from the functional design. </t>  <t> The remote will use standard batteries. </t>  <t> NA. </t> ", "A : so we are here for the concept design meeting .\nA : so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .\nA : will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards .\nA : so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours .\nA : we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .\nA : so , last time we decided to have simple interface .\nA : we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button .\nA : channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple .\nA : we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ .\nA : we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features .\nA : so now we will have three presentations .\nA : so the conceptual specification by industrial designer , the specification of the u_i_ by or u_i_ .\nC : abdul al-hasred is my name .\nA : and the last point is trend watching by market expert .\nA : so we can start with industrial design .\nA : so this is the presentation .\nB : i_d_ you want ?\nA : switch slide on your request .\nB : only have three slides , so .\nB : look at the just this .\nB : on some web pages to find some documentation and remote control is , as mentioned previously , you just have very simple chip and the the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using wheel control .\nB : so was looking for that chip , which is very very standard , and looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button .\nB : and we can change directly .\nB : have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control .\nB : the push button are usually extremely cheap , but have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .\nB : and we if we could just talk about that if we really need wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button .\nB : wheel sensor is fifty time the price of push button .\nA : but is it significant price on the whole remote control ?\nA : because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control .\nB : but don't think that we should we should talk about the design of the box also which needs some money .\nA : so will will will this with including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be lower than twelve euros to produce ?\nA : you received something .\nC : also have to say did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?\nB : but that's all .\nC : you we an email from the manufacturing division that they have voice recognition chip already developed .\nC : it says that ri now they just use it to to record answers to particular questions .\nC : but it could be it's possible .\nA : and could it be adapted ?\nC : instead of recording the answers you can just record something simpler like command .\nA : and there can recognize some commands and ?\nC : you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and , so if they already have it as as chip then we we could use it .\nA : we can just listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .\nB : but it's , haven't written my personal references .\nB : the want to mention the the problem of the the wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that .\nB : we we have already some good things with with the backlight of the push button .\nC : have question about that actually .\nC : what is the purpose of the light ?\nB : just to to make something which is slightly more design that squarey box with rubber .\nC : is but but in in the dark but is going to be always turned on , the light ?\nA : you can easily find the button in the dark or so ?\nA : it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control , no ?\nC : but if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it .\nC : you can see the buttons better , .\nC : but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement .\nB : as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .\nC : but you need another sensor for that , ?\nC : no it's too expensive .\nB : don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen very cheap devices but the bill starts to be first of all was thinking to have continuous light and you when you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device , little bit .\nC : but expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , .\nA : but it can be battery consuming , no ?\nA : to have the light always on ?\nA : will discuss that after the other presentations .\nC : so my one , it should be in the shared folder .\nC : it was last time saw it .\nA : and it is .\nC : so , just move to the next slide .\nC : so want very simple , ?\nC : that's the major idea , as simple as possible .\nC : so look at some current designs on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls .\nC : and let's look at two of them because even though they have many buttons they look quite simple .\nC : and in our case we just reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .\nA : and also does it fit hand ?\nA : because it was your wrist problem with the usage .\nC : this these these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so .\nC : we have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .\nC : so , from the bottom or whatever is there , the the numbers and then the top , until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same .\nC : so it's more or less how we would like it , with big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , ?\nC : these are the basic thing .\nA : so it's only the central part .\nC : so , software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .\nA : with more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .\nC : if you have , that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .\nC : it could be on the side , .\nC : because we don't have these input buttons and this other that they have .\nC : and that the plastic cover is not very good idea because you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things .\nC : you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere bit out of the way .\nC : so that they're separate bit , .\nA : will be down or .\nC : and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either .\nC : that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .\nC : alright , you won't .\nC : usually what have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for tuning the channels and like that .\nC : that you want to protect bit .\nC : and it's it's reasonable .\nC : so , don't , this is just the the wheel .\nC : we could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .\nC : so we could just use one just wheel and user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .\nA : the wheel will be good advantage over our competitors .\nA : because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple .\nA : so it's worse to to have more expense on that's that aspect .\nC : the market researcher will tell us all about that .\nA : so we can move to the is there any question ?\nA : for designer of user interface ?\nA : or we can move to the next part , , and discuss afterwards ?\nD : so now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control .\nD : so , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel .\nD : and the second aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative .\nD : and the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use .\nD : so , are things we are we have speak about before .\nD : and so you you can go after .\nD : and there is fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends , fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .\nD : so , if our remote control have to be fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or and the the material is expected to be spongy .\nB : support an apple .\nD : which material can be spongy , and if you .\nA : this is good also for .\nC : wou wou we can certainly just put the electronics in spongy thing , it it would work , ?\nA : it is good also to have spongy material , .\nC : you can throw it to the television .\nA : because it's robust .\nD : it's robust , .\nC : we could say that if you throw it , you have sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .\nC : when it takes shock .\nB : know that they do that for alarm clock also .\nD : an and and this you can you can say that .\nD : you ca you can go before , before , yes .\nD : and here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is technological innovative , and after the easy to use .\nA : it's innovative to use the the wheel because no one else has .\nD : that's why that's why we have to keep that if it's possible .\nA : it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .\nA : so it's good aspect and it should be kept .\nC : how do we make it look is the question .\nA : we have to make it look like fruit or vegetable .\nA : colour that remember some fruit , things like that .\nB : what about and for look and feel , what about piece of ice , with blue l_e_d_ inside ?\nC : the obvious thing is banana , .\nD : about pear , .\nD : the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and .\nA : and it's ergonomic as .\nC : the banana is also ergonomic .\nA : pear like that .\nD : or fruit like that .\nA : we can discuss that .\nA : is is there anything you want to add ?\nC : is there any fruit that is spongy ?\nA : we we can have like pear is good , fit , or banana as you told .\nA : something like that .\nA : but that's not in the trend .\nC : you can make it it's not hard , the metal .\nA : the trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .\nA : spongy is good because it it will be robust as .\nA : so , we can keep the wheel because it's easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is bit higher , and we also have to find , so , fruit like pear or banana wit any others idea you have .\nA : what fr fruit would you like to to control your t_v_ with ?\nA : odi banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .\nB : banana , it's idea .\nB : because but you you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have push button to .\nC : two of the button , .\nD : but you don't have .\nA : it's good idea , .\nC : so you can just have just have this curve , , and you move your hand here to press the buttons and then you move on the other side .\nC : so you can have it on on two sides and it'll be , no ?\nA : it's good design and it's innovative as then .\nA : we can keep the banana .\nA : and it will be very easy to find .\nC : you can put also vibrator inside .\nB : and everybody knows what is banana .\nB : if you if you start with fancy fruits and fra and tha , so so we will just use standard battery ?\nC : you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .\nA : it's really really good point .\nC : hope the students of management die , but anyway .\nC : now who are recording this meeting ?\nA : it so one second .\nA : so we have to take some decision on this aspect .\nA : so , so for , for component , so we have to think about those aspects , .\nB : and the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use .\nB : what do you mean by case ?\nA : it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .\nB : for me if we use spongy banana case , doesn't matter .\nB : want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .\nC : that can be in inside in the structure .\nC : but the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to if it's spongy then it's going to move , ?\nC : so , it's going to be bend lot .\nC : so if we try to push the buttons , it you t's possible ?\nB : no it's possible .\nA : but no the button would be it it should be something odd shaped , with spongy cover .\nB : this is like the .\nA : odd shape with spongy cover .\nA : and standard battery , chip imprint , there's no specific problem .\nA : so we agree to put the wheel so it have to it has to be symmetrical .\nB : wheel on the top .\nB : button , where do we want some buttons ?\nC : usually hold , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , ?\nC : sa let's say that it has to be you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is also the thumb .\nC : or you could use use this one , but if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .\nA : the thumb is more comfortable .\nC : this for the wheel and then this for the buttons ?\nA : it's for both and left .\nC : should have the two sides .\nC : so if the left , we have the op wheel wheel buttons .\nA : you can turn it this way also .\nA : you can do both with both hands .\nC : the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side .\nC : so you cannot see them .\nA : you you will get used to it .\nA : and moreover , the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the side , because you have light on buttons .\nC : so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be know , but if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .\nA : no you you you will use it only on the or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty .\nA : for lefty it's .\nA : do this movement , and for righty as .\nA : this doesn't change that much .\nA : so , for interface we said also that we have this banana shape with button on the on the side .\nA : and and wheel on the top .\nA : so the colour is yellow .\nA : it's we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , .\nA : so we can we can work on those aspects until next meeting .\nA : so have the final look and feel design according to the decision .\nA : and have the the user interface design and then evaluate the prodyuc the product .\nA : that is to say , check if it fit the the requirement given by the users , but according to your presentation it seems to be .\nA : it seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use .\nA : so so to prepare the prototype would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer work together .\nA : that would be better , .\nA : and and so you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual .\nA : so do you need to add anything ?\nA : you feel free to express what you want to say ?\nA : you don't feel too constrained ?\nA : you don't feel free to answer this ?\nC : you can make .\nA : so see you ."], ["<t> The Project Manager presented the final cost of the remote with the finalized list of components. </t>  <t> The final cost was under the alotted budget; the Project Manager announced that the project could then continue with the current prototype. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype to the group. </t>  <t> The group evaluated the prototype based on the requirements of users presented in the first meetings. </t>  <t> The group decided that the prototype met enough of these goals to be able to market the product. </t>  <t> The prototype was presented and the group discussed the look of the prototype. </t>  <t> The Project Manager summarized the accomplishments of the meeting. </t>  <t> The group decided that the final cost of the prototype was low enough that they could continue with the current prototype and still meet the profit goals. </t>  <t> The group also decided that the design of the prototype was satisfactory and met enough of the users' requirements to be able to be marketed. </t>  <t> NA. </t> ", "A : je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype .\nA : it really looks like banana .\nC : it is banana .\nA : it is banana .\nC : it is the essence of bananas .\nC : would be confused with this thing .\nC : how is everyone ?\nA : so we are here for the detailed design meeting .\nA : so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .\nA : then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual .\nA : we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work .\nA : and then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product .\nA : then we will evaluate the product .\nA : and end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not .\nA : so let's start with the cost aspect so so look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say to have standard battery , to have yellow banana shaped case with rubber material around it to be to feel spongy , and also at the different aspect like having wheel etcetera .\nA : and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros .\nA : so which is good , because we had price gap of twelve point five euros .\nA : so for the financial aspect it's , we can we can continue with this product as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with our marketing expert .\nD : so you can have my project in just four .\nA : you have presentation ?\nA : participant four , yes .\nD : so you can go .\nD : we can go through .\nD : so made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about during the previous meetings .\nD : so you can go through and so we have six points .\nD : we we talked about before .\nD : so we we want to have product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in room , and robust , and have scale of seven points .\nD : so go through all the all the points here , and according to what you think about the this project you can make one point , two point or seven point .\nD : and after we ha we have an an average , and we see .\nD : so fancy look and feel , what do you think ?\nA : you can presen .\nD : between one and seven .\nA : so it's very very .\nC : give it give it five .\nA : what do you think ?\nA : so it's between one and seven ?\nA : seven is the highest ?\nD : seven is the .\nA : will give six .\nB : will give five .\nC : do you vote christine ?\nC : do you also vote ?\nD : no , want to see something .\nA : we all have to agree on common .\nC : we can very easily .\nD : and need to as .\nD : need to if you we ha we have to put one if it's better or uh-uh .\nA : so this is your one is most .\nC : so it will have five point five average .\nA : we can choose what we want .\nA : let's say that seven is the best .\nD : or we can say seven is the best .\nA : so so do note the grade we have five , six for me , five .\nA : and what what's your choice ?\nD : six you can how much what ?\nA : how much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?\nA : how much would you you don't answer to this questionnaire ?\nD : yes , six , it's good .\nA : five point five average .\nA : does it , techne technological aspect .\nD : so after , the technological aspect ?\nD : so we we said we have new technological thing with wheel .\nA : we have the wheel .\nA : we also have the rubber material , which make it like new also .\nA : would give five .\nB : four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation .\nB : the rubber is four .\nC : are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ?\nA : so what's your grade ?\nA : so we have four , four and five ?\nD : we can put four ?\nC : for twenty five .\nD : everyone is or four poin four .\nA : four , , let's put four .\nA : doesn't it , so .\nD : very easy to use .\nD : do you t's easy to use ?\nC : give seven , .\nA : would give would give seven as .\nA : it's very easy to use .\nD : six for me also .\nA : so six point five .\nD : six point five .\nB : six six six point five .\nD : is it fashion ?\nA : its its its fruit fruit shape .\nA : would say seven .\nA : and is very very design .\nD : it's fashion , because it's fruit , and we say that the , seven .\nC : we can we can put seven here .\nB : easy to find .\nD : easy to find in room ?\nB : lost my banana .\nA : you can't miss it .\nC : we can put six here .\nD : we have the lightning , or the lighting .\nA : we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but so it's yellow .\nC : so you'll make the material transparent so that it lights up completely , or .\nA : it's very easy to would say seven .\nA : it's hard to miss it .\nD : is it is it robust ?\nA : it's rubber , made of rubber , it's it's more rubber than other remote control .\nB : it's ru it's rubber .\nC : the only problem there might be which know , if it's very sensitive , they will , , .\nA : but it is it is surrounded by rubber material .\nA : so we can put six .\nB : six or five .\nD : everybody is , six .\nC : six , , for me .\nA : we have to sum up everything .\nD : thirteen , twenty , twenty six point five , seven , thirty two , thirty six .\nA : six is good , the be .\nD : if we say that seven it's it's the better , and when six sit six are good it's good product , .\nA : so six is so it's good evaluation , .\nC : so will become eight soon ?\nA : it's very promising .\nC : t's bit biased .\nD : we have good price and .\nA : so this prototype is quite .\nC : because saw some phones that were banana shaped , wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , quite big also , and they were selling something like hundred euros , two hundred euros .\nC : just just phone , wireless .\nA : so having this at twenty five euros is quite attractive , .\nB : but almo also the complexity between phone and remote control is not cannot compare .\nC : it's much more complex , but .\nA : so , , we can summarise .\nA : so we have seen the prototype .\nA : it's very according to the work of our two designer .\nA : the the the financial aspect were .\nA : we we have the cost below our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five euros and make make profit .\nA : the the evaluation give satisfying result as .\nA : so we can move to the last part of the meeting .\nA : so the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is , so we can now open champagne and make huge party .\nB : start to eat banana .\nA : if it's provided by by the meeting staff .\nC : congratulations to the team .\nC : very , we worked together fantastically .\nA : it was good collaboration .\nC : so what does the management say ?\nC : what does the management say ?\nA : we will have much bigger project next time and much bigger salary as .\nA : all it depends on who watch this meeting .\nA : so good , so see you for next successful project ."], ["<t> The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer presented the basic components of a remote control device and how they work together. </t>  <t> He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device. </t>  <t> The group discussed not being able to include a teletext component, and that the product design would have to be the main selling point of the device. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project, again stressing the attractiveness of the product design. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature. </t>  <t> The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor. </t>  <t> The group decided that they want to incorporate teletext despite the management's directive. </t>  <t> The group does not want to include the battery charging stand. </t>  <t> There was a lack of information about the cost of components and materials. </t>  <t> The group felt constrained by the new project requirements and had difficulties implementing the management's directives. </t> ", "A : so we are here to talk about functional design .\nA : now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now .\nA : so here's an agenda .\nA : you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation .\nA : the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful .\nA : now you can all give your presentations .\nA : we can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions .\nA : forty minutes for this meeting , so bit more time than the last one .\nA : here's the additional points wanted to put those in there to see if you had any comments on them .\nA : did you all receive that email ?\nA : so does anyone have any overall .\nD : what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing product that is going to be having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be new product without something that people are very comfortable having now .\nD : so that's , from marketing perspective see see lack .\nD : and so we have to go , , in the other direction .\nD : what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than .\nA : tha that first point could also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that's presented , .\nD : no , agree with you .\nD : so what i'm talking about is see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta .\nD : so that's that's that was my reactions .\nA : but but we are being dictated that this should only be for the television .\nA : so we're quite fixed .\nA : so we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's that's cost winner rather than fantastic new feature product .\nC : bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the t_v_ .\nC : so we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any t_v_ that we people use our remote with .\nD : we take with you .\nC : so it's stupid decision .\nA : but there's also the potential for mark there's market here for our lost teletext .\nA : someone that just goes to the shop that wants replacement wants it as cheap as possible .\nA : twenty-five euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here .\nD : that's what i'm that's what i'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext .\nD : 'cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext .\nD : so so it's it's not that i'm criticizing the product .\nD : it's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ?\nD : what are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to in my opinion we have to double up .\nD : if we lose one we need to bring two or three .\nA : that the last point is probably quite straightforward .\nA : the the it has to be branded .\nC : so then the double will be our our tho tho thou rol ro rolls-royce might mind , but don't worry .\nA : on the product .\nB : one of , , one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we're doing this our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , .\nA : can you handle that black and yellow ?\nB : so our our target here is to have some very like sleek look remote and we want it to be functional as , but one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here .\nB : we don't wanna big clunker .\nB : we want something that looks and it's fashionable and so that's fine .\nD : so you have this ?\nA : so we have three presentations , and we'll go in order of participant number here .\nA : so we can have look at the working design first from participant two .\nB : so so you all know me , i'm the industrial designer .\nA : but click it on off ?\nB : and we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need , just every remote'll need .\nB : we need some kinda of power power source .\nB : we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also major component .\nB : we need programmable digital signal processor to to take the input from the user and translate that into into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red l_e_d_ , which you aim at the television which and it receives that signal .\nB : you need on-off switch how that got in there .\nB : and we also need to have the if we want universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of t_v_s .\nB : so we need to know all the different all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as .\nB : so here's just basic layout of how how the remote would work .\nB : you ha the the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red l_e_d_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor .\nB : so those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is open to move around .\nD : now is would this be considered just standard this is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here .\nB : any des no .\nD : we're talking about existing technology .\nB : this is just this is just basic layout of ev of all the components that are gonna be necessary to have working remote .\nD : nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries .\nB : we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , that that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip .\nA : do we have an idea of costs of different components ?\nB : but the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the it could als the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as .\nB : the l_e_d_ and the the transistors and everything else are they're they're pretty cheap .\nB : so depending on what we want our functionality to be , the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap .\nB : depending on the amount of memory we need in there and like that and and how much power .\nA : do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ?\nB : don't have any figures now .\nB : we we have to until we get to more specific design phase for that .\nB : but and significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and the the the buttons and things like that , .\nB : that's all have really .\nA : and we have participant three , which believe is pedro .\nA : give you that to click on .\nA : and you wanna get view slide show , that's what you wanna do , ?\nC : when we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun .\nA : just go up to view .\nB : click , don't .\nA : but what the the management recommendation was less that there's worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it .\nC : this doesn't work .\nC : so function design .\nC : you know me , pedro , and what found is we want to do fashion and , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple and try to aim for design .\nC : if case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good .\nC : something cute and small .\nC : the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties .\nC : so we should just go that people will like to actually look at .\nC : and although mo most people will buy televisions and everything for that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the to the television to , , tune in their the stations .\nC : there's no need to have that in the remote .\nC : so as for what would recommend for the the interface design , and will change the colours on the on the logo , but we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics .\nC : and although i'm still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that , , but we should go for the .\nA : so still it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there .\nA : because otherwise we're just going to even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between remote with teletext or without when it really if it if it isn't more expensive for us to make because as far as understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , ?\nB : as far as it's just the cost of an extra button .\nA : so it should be in there .\nB : software-wise there's really no difference .\nA : isn't what we're getting into here is the the idea of internet through the t_v_ .\nD : have silly question .\nD : in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext .\nD : don't understand how those two things are connected .\nD : how does how does computers and teletext how why is one eliminating the need of the other ?\nD : don't understand that .\nA : so that might play on what we can do .\nC : the they're aiming at saying that you would use couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for the scheduling and the next programme and like that and now and now you can look it over internet .\nB : to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials .\nC : but still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities .\nD : 'cause , , don't see the cross-over between computers and television .\nD : do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , .\nC : but it's not happen yet .\nA : you have digital t_v_ still already .\nD : so so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote .\nB : unless you have .\nA : there there is on digital t_v_ systems you have you can press button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can you can view through catalogue .\nA : family member of mine has got system where you just you can , and there's other features on other systems where you can pause live t_v_ and things like that .\nA : they're just features from the internet from computers are are coming into the t_v_ under the covers , but you still use it through teletext .\nA : so now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle .\nC : but we we don't we're not aiming command for that .\nC : that's the thing .\nC : and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and but we would increase the price to try to make it trainable one , so dunno .\nB : lot of that's proprietary anyways .\nB : you're not gonna be able to , you , like command tivo with our remote .\nA : but still there there's an opportunity .\nA : if if it's , , trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , , an button like that might might do as future proofing it .\nC : one way the other teletext was there but we can remove it or , , make two separate interface designs .\nB : if it's possible you should try to have talk with management about that .\nB : just it's just not .\nD : don't don't see the logic .\nD : don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , but i'm not tech-mind either .\nA : and neither do .\nD : don't see the cross-over between computers and and and 'cause we are designing something for television , .\nA : i'll communicate that back to those there and the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated there's no logic in not having it in there anyway if it doesn't affect the price .\nD : we are selling it to an existing market .\nA : but what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext .\nC : but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext .\nD : that's , and and , , and and we're also marketing product .\nC : that's the problem .\nD : it's what i'm seeing is is mid-range cost product .\nD : so so we can't go and pump whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of sudden we are gonna have cost overruns .\nD : so if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ?\nA : so if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it is it's just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that thing .\nA : 'cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ?\nD : don't don't see it , and to me if i'm gonna market product for for beauty for for design i'm gonna i'm gonna try to market it at much higher price .\nD : need to make it special with high price tag .\nD : don't want to make it economically competitive .\nD : want want to market it as exclusive .\nD : so would market this product it at eighty-nine euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design but but don't think we have that flexibility .\nA : but if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five euros is probably high price for commoner garden stan standard t_v_ so the place remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it sleek elegant high-priced basic remote .\nA : does that make sense , ?\nD : no no understand what you say , but what i'm what i'm , we probably need to move along , but my my concern is trying to find marketing niche for this product , and if i'm coming in with with with twenty-five euros , which is mid-market price , then what am going to give these people for this ?\nA : we probably should .\nA : we we're doing alright for time .\nD : so that's just my question , but we can keep talking .\nA : that kinda cut into you there .\nC : no just would would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands .\nC : as for , , the the case design i'll come up with more concrete ideas .\nC : now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small .\nB : i'm just thinking with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions .\nB : where the largest portion of the market is just gonna they lost their t_v_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their t_v_ .\nB : they want something that looks , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that that it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that .\nB : that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , , market share .\nA : so we are looking that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features .\nB : the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits .\nB : because as we as we add costs for things like for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , what percentage of the of the of the market is actually gonna use that ?\nB : five percent , , and how much .\nA : but we can talk little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this .\nA : be good idea .\nA : didn't mean to cut in .\nA : i'm not the boss .\nD : pedro , want to say quickly would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , .\nD : sell things come to my mind is something that's voice-activated .\nD : know we're getting into some , hope , some big money on this thing , but is that for over here ?\nA : that's probably question more for for this guy here , .\nB : t's kinda both of us .\nB : us us user interface .\nD : that's 'cause and of voice-activated of of how many times i've i've lost my my remote and 't find it .\nD : so some way that find my remote by clapping my hands and and so so but this 's just something .\nB : was thinking about that .\nB : then your lights would go off , though .\nD : i'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ?\nD : what makes this thing attractive ?\nD : and it's only for televisions .\nD : so we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use for their v_c_r_s , their d_v_d_s , their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only .\nD : and so to me we have to make this really special product don't really have to say don't see the market niche for this product .\nD : at this price don't see it yet .\nD : i'm go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but don't see the market niche for this product without without some really something really special to identify it as as unique in the market .\nC : but we that should be design .\nC : that should be the design .\nC : technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it .\nC : we don't have the money to do it towards technology so we should we should aim at design .\nD : have to do you have to do it in the box ?\nD : so so that's up to you then to to make this box in something that's extraordinary .\nD : make it in the form of gun .\nD : we can sell it in united states .\nA : have question for you .\nA : does any of the the features that pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ?\nA : in terms of making it work or the cost of that or .\nB : don't all these things are pretty standard .\nA : onto participant four .\nD : for marketing marketing for me is and how do go here ?\nB : you can just click .\nB : no no no you just get off that .\nB : you just click anywhere .\nD : what for me is it what i'm marketing now , , 'til you spoke and when wrote this , what i'm marketing .\nD : know that was identified as we identified ourselves as as developer , as manufacturer , and as as distributor to other wholesalers .\nD : and so the the twenty-five euros that we've identified as the sale price is wholesale price rather than retail price .\nD : that's what we decided here .\nD : so what did is decided that that this this needs to be product in in sense can market itself .\nD : so what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design .\nD : we're making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is .\nD : so that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left .\nD : so would like to have product that that we can sell easily .\nD : so say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , something that in sense will sell itself .\nD : innovation fits into what we're talking about here with design .\nD : cutting edge technology , don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas was putting together , unless we come up with some new age product as far as the casing is concerned .\nD : wanna make this thing something that identify as special in some way , so we can have some talked about environmentally sensitive , we have product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in home .\nD : these are just thoughts .\nD : wanted to talk about who we are as as corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide product from new perspective rather than from an old corporate line .\nD : so to me it's about selling our identity our corporate identity along with the product .\nD : what found is that the projected costs are competitive .\nD : we're in the middle of the market , but what i'm seeing is that the market is ready for identified new technology , but again , because what see is budget restrictions and limitations , that we can bring any new technology into this thing .\nD : if if we could have technological something .\nB : have an idea .\nB : and it's along the lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's common issue .\nB : what we can do is , that batteries throwing aw remotes run through batteries like crazy .\nB : and for some people .\nB : not solar remote but instead what about if we had like power cradle ?\nD : but solar blah , like it .\nB : like cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , , replaceable batteries we'll just have power cell that stays there for the life of the remote .\nB : you never have to get go through the go through all these different batteries .\nB : and also you can it's good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as whole .\nB : you could have some neat little , , sexy design for cradle and the remote itself .\nD : like the idea , but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double .\nB : it it would increase the cost .\nD : but boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , we can identify it as safer product in some form .\nB : and you could page the remote if you lose it .\nB : there's button on the cradle .\nD : really see but the cost no no .\nA : now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ?\nD : no no , we have we have to change the end cost .\nD : there's don't see it anyway .\nA : we we do we necessarily have to change the end cost because can we dl can we do that without changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we can sell more based on this ?\nD : that's gonna be up to these .\nD : my reaction is no , but , see see i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product .\nB : what do is look into ho pedro and look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers .\nA : we we can certainly push for more expensive product if that's gonna be nah , we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext .\nD : let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty euros , sixty euros .\nD : let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high-tech design , ergonomics , all of this .\nD : just make this thing , , the the the rolls royce of of remote controls .\nD : every home's got to have it .\nD : if you don't have one , what remote do you have ?\nD : you've got one of those , fantastic , want one of those too .\nD : don't have enough money now .\nB : about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that level we'd need to have every functionality the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , , the d_v_d_ player and , , the stereo system and all that .\nB : which is pretty basic function that we've opted out of .\nB : and additionally we're not supporting teletext but do think there are some basic features that we don't have that lot of other remotes are going to have .\nD : one one thing don't understand is they've they've given us this package , .\nD : now in my opinion we need to give them package back , .\nD : they say they say here you go .\nD : they gave us fundament foundation of of what they want , and and it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate .\nD : don't t's our place to create their product for them , it is .\nD : what role we have in this in the corporate ladder , but to me it's like , , you have got your here's our ideas , .\nD : and then let them look at those ideas and they say , , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , we like this idea , this idea no , but to me it's it's about choice , do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and and then and then discuss ?\nD : beca do not do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing handing us now .\nD : don't see it .\nB : don have to disagree though .\nB : our market niche is people who need who have lost their remote or who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote .\nB : it does what they need .\nB : these aren't that it .\nA : and and to get to back to another point , for cutting in but , it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple t_v_s , , 'cause it's selling on its own .\nA : it's not going to be specifically for hitachi t_v_s or or whatever .\nD : no understand that .\nA : so technologically , if understand it , t_v_s t_v_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and d_v_d_ remotes .\nA : all you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the like some four-digit code .\nA : so saying that it works with all t_v_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with d_v_d_s and other things .\nD : nope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions .\nC : you you wouldn't the interface will be different .\nD : they've identified this product limita that's why say don't don't see the market niche for this .\nA : we have done this .\nD : if we if if we were going to have product that worked for d_v_d_s , v_c_r_s and everything , then see the market niche , but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext .\nD : and it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , because who wants just television remote ?\nB : we he here's my thing about that .\nB : if you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just television remote .\nB : if it can't control if it can't control your your d_v_d_ player and al if if you can't get th-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away .\nB : i'm not gonna buy seventy-five euro remote .\nD : have tendency to agree with you .\nA : so we really can't chase that .\nD : that's why say quest question the marketability of the product .\nD : really question where we create the demand .\nB : so what we so that's what i'm saying .\nA : we're really looking basic .\nA : the the one thing that that that you said really struck chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for large profit at the same time where i'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here .\nA : we're selling more than just the product .\nA : we're trying to get mind-share about real reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics .\nA : we want people to eventually say , that's that's real reaction that's good make .\nA : and and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by either being fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , and solid .\nA : so if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking that's in itself an extremely big thing .\nD : if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of sudden now we're going into an new market area .\nD : so we can say low-cost good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da .\nA : we only have few minutes left .\nD : but what i'm saying is now we're middle market .\nA : is twenty-five euros mid-market price for remote ?\nD : for for multi for multi-function remote , that's mid-market price .\nD : in discount now you can buy on sale sometimes for about about eighteen , nineteen euro , and that's for the multi-functions , d_v_d_ , v_c_r_ , catch-alls .\nD : and and they have in little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls .\nD : so to me , to market this only television remote control we have to change consciousness .\nD : we have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and what that is .\nD : it's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features .\nA : 'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it .\nA : if we can take it down to fifteen rather than twenty-five and make low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand .\nA : we have five minutes left .\nA : rather to to to sell for real reactions .\nD : or my we're talking about the other end now .\nA : and communicate this to to the more senior people within the company here to to get reaction .\nB : what about the idea that had with the cradle ?\nB : how do you feel about that ?\nB : or how does everybody feel ?\nA : how does everybody feel ?\nA : the other the the problem with that in my mind think off-hand as as consumer , would wanna buy that ?\nD : like the idea , but we have we have to find out .\nB : no , but that's the thing don't t's necessarily the other end .\nA : and not because i've got remote and i'll take it to different chairs , i'll take it to different don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down .\nA : it if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , and that implies that there's only one t_v_ user .\nA : so it's very good for some people but it's not like but it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to certain extent .\nB : lasts it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle .\nA : you have to remember .\nA : you have to shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and .\nA : it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that i'd really want because of that fact .\nA : but , that's just my opinion .\nD : again it's it we have cost issue here .\nD : if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range .\nD : are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as high high-tech environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ?\nD : again don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet .\nD : don't see it yet .\nA : so what do we think we should pedro , do you have any opinion on it ?\nC : we should keep it simple , medium-low cost mar cost area and make it look good .\nD : question have in in 'cause agree with you on , we gotta make it box .\nD : the box is gonna sell it , the outside , the casing .\nA : really need to wrap up now .\nD : can can can we have multiple designs ?\nD : have modern , have traditional , have , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have four or five different designs they can choose from .\nD : what that creates cost , or one over another .\nB : the the problem with that is we may end up with whole bunch of inventory of of poor design .\nD : , hear that .\nB : so but what we could do is some we we need to , , have few designs to look at and then come up with something that we all agree is , , the best fit .\nB : what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to and it's really important that it doesn't look cheap .\nB : we have to make people look at it an and feel like it its like quality remote .\nB : even though the cost may be low .\nD : what ab what ab what about remote that's that doesn't look like remote ?\nD : just an idea .\nD : just just 'cause we all remote looks like on the outside .\nD : they're selling these things everywhere .\nD : that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make remote that doesn't even look like remote it it opens like telephone .\nB : or what if it looks like pen ?\nD : doesn't matter , .\nD : i'm just jus talking about some something to make this thing unique .\nD : it that's the thing , i'm gonna keep thumping on .\nD : i'll sell whatever you design .\nD : don't have problem selling product , that's not the issue .\nD : give you ideas , you create the product .\nD : once you have the finished product i'll find way to sell it .\nD : don't worry about it .\nD : give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings .\nB : so just to touch on my point one last time that had brought up .\nB : really un unless you are die-hard against the fact that it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , it still might be good idea to investigate having like power cradle .\nB : because really in certain sense it almost like for me would want to have that just , because know at the end of when i'm done watching t_v_ that when i'm done , better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs .\nB : that's just some people that like that .\nA : there's al there's also remote controls remember that that worked , this hasn't been done in while , but as as watch .\nB : lot of people as watch ?\nA : there is remote control watches , but they're sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now .\nC : they are not simple .\nA : those things may have been inexpensive for all know .\nD : one thing thought about when you were saying that , is that the our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken we gotta stop ?\nB : that's what was saying .\nD : who's lost or broken their their remote .\nA : gotta cut up .\nD : so how many remotes do they wanna buy ?\nD : can we can we sell them remote that can guarantee they will not need to buy another one ?\nD : and so with with with this system or locator , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ?\nD : how does this happen ?\nA : the last remote you'll ever buy .\nB : and also presumably they've exactly .\nD : and and then and then design the product , some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy .\nA : if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be quite expensive to make .\nA : whereas actually just putting it in power cradle might not be too expensive because that's just done with mobile phones you can just we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there .\nB : the locator'll definitely be more expensive .\nA : need to look into whether we can do that but we we have some mobile phone-based products checking quickly our internet .\nA : we really need to finish up here .\nD : we can make it in the shape of coffee pot .\nA : but we have the the power-adaptor products .\nA : we sell power-adaptor products .\nA : so there's nothing stopping us using that technology .\nD : it's just it's that it's telling us to stop our meeting .\nD : so we have the we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about .\nA : so , without it being too we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here .\nD : if if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics .\nB : one of the things that we can put on the box is , never buy another battery .\nB : something like that .\nD : no that's not what want , want look it here ."], ["<t> The Industrial Designer presented an overview of the internal components of a remote control device. </t>  <t> He discussed energy source and

?\nA : we may do .\nD : can he get it all by himself this time ?\nA : i'm feeling like big boy .\nC : pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much .\nD : so believe fly .\nC : he's getting retarded .\nB : alright got some exciting for you .\nD : just what needed was something exciting .\nD : remember , i'm an old man .\nA : ready to go ?\nA : so we've got our conceptual design meeting .\nC : i'm old as .\nA : hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now .\nD : thirty's really young , ?\nA : so here's our agenda our agenda .\nA : i'm gonna open .\nA : i'm gonna talk for bit about what we're gonna do .\nA : i'm gonna take some notes .\nA : we're gonna all do presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now .\nA : when say hopefully , we have to .\nA : so i'm gonna let you talk before we make decisions .\nA : and does anyone really want to go first ?\nB : i'll go first .\nA : what's components design .\nC : presented by name .\nB : my name is .\nD : jose he man is .\nA : your name is name ?\nB : my name is name .\nC : my name is inigo montoya .\nC : you killed my father .\nB : did this in bit of rush .\nC : prepare to die .\nB : so so here's look inside your really old-looking remote control .\nB : you've got printed printed circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate we've all broken remote control .\nA : we've all broke remote control ri .\nD : i've love you tech , .\nB : so you've also got you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics .\nB : so you've got here's here's transistor , and this amplifies your signal , you've got the l_e_d_ here on the end of the on the end of the printed circuit board .\nD : they just do jabber .\nC : there's thingy and dingy and nah .\nA : you press this and it does who and whatnot .\nB : you've got couple diodes here for who and whatnot .\nB : so we've got in this in this drawing he in this example here , this is eighteen pin chip .\nB : it's two double batteries .\nB : this is pretty standard remote .\nB : so here are options for our power sources .\nB : you can use basic battery , which we've already discussed , our tech department also said we have the option of doing some hand dynamo where you crank it like that .\nB : if that's really we got some qu crazy down there in that department so you shake it .\nC : wanna change that .\nD : gotta gotta flashlight , and but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this .\nB : so that's the next bullet is the the kinetic provision of energy , so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it .\nD : and that's on the camera .\nB : we've got solar cells , which don't very good idea because you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make lot of sense .\nB : and finally we've got our cradle our power cradle idea .\nA : so we have battery versus cradle here ?\nB : battery versus cradle is .\nC : like the kinetic .\nA : so we have battery versus cradle it's actually novel thing because you could sell it as novelty , just to be actually serious for minute here , you could .\nD : figured you would .\nB : it could be fun .\nB : is it is more it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle .\nB : so our case design .\nB : we have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do .\nB : our material choices are plastic latex ty or plastic , rubber latex type thing , wood , or titanium .\nB : if we go with titanium we're gonna be limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and pers wood 't see anybody wanting to use wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , .\nA : wood wood would ge would give us little bit of marketing niche , wouldn't it .\nD : it it it .\nD : to me in marketing sense it's not it's not relative .\nD : we can we can we can accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find way to accentuate it .\nB : and what we may be able to do , and this might be the best option is to combine some couple of these .\nB : my recommendation personally would be to do some plastic inner shell with like rubber outer shell , to make it to mak like thick plastic inner shell and to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also it feels little better than the plastic .\nA : do you get good grip on the rubber ?\nD : and if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce back up in your hand .\nD : you don't even need to lean down to get it .\nB : the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is we we'll have lot more options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in any shape you want .\nB : so and then we can cover the breakable bits with rubber so but these are curved and double-curved believe that the tech department , in their in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of curves in the bottom .\nB : have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved .\nB : would this like this pen would be kinda like double-curved , where it's curved on multiple axes , ?\nB : curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes or surfaces .\nB : have no idea .\nA : it might mean something like that sorta shape because double curve rather than that's what .\nD : that's that's what see .\nB : like wave , .\nD : that's what see also .\nB : alright that makes sense .\nB : with the interface we have the following options , we can we can use push buttons , we can use scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and display , or multiple scrolling wheels .\nB : so these are all options that the user interface guy can has at his disposal to put together user interface .\nB : for electronics , we have these very technical descriptions here .\nB : simple chip , which is the least expensive , but have no numbers to give you , regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense yes the difference is , with simple chip simple chip will operate why doesn't this scroll up ?\nA : do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between simple chip and an advanced chip ?\nB : previous previous , .\nB : simple chip is required to operate push buttons .\nB : an advanced chip is required to to operate the display , and it didn't say specifically , but have hunch that regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .\nA : that makes sense .\nB : that's the end of my presentation .\nA : so presentation from design would go best .\nA : technical functions or interface concept ?\nC : very long presentation .\nA : yes , but it has your name on it .\nC : that doesn't bo bode for it for it tats as .\nC : so , somehow that thing's too big , but our manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition .\nC : they say they could put it to work but we don't .\nC : it it it you'll be be affected by the by the other speech and and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , and that's one of the things we wanna keep .\nB : if the t_v_ is working , .\nB : that's just it'll if somebody says up in the middle of television show , it's gonna change the channel .\nB : so then why don't you just press the up button ?\nA : but what if you actually had to press button to make it recognize ?\nA : so if you pressed it and went , up ?\nC : that kinda would .\nC : that would lose it .\nA : but if it's just one thing with button that you can just go up .\nB : even still there's gonna be interf there's there still will be interference from the t_v_ .\nB : it might not be it might not be completely confusing , but you'll still it's still don't t's practical .\nB : it's bad idea frankly .\nC : so taking that away , our the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls .\nA : you know your .\nC : as for the point that we making about losing it .\nC : we wanna small remote control one side because we want it to be and designed , but market shows that bigger bigger remotes get less lost , about but we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that .\nB : that would believe .\nC : so the the what would propose is something more or less in the direction of what is to yo the of that slide but without with less complicated design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access .\nC : the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was round dial .\nC : and if you just think about it as the one to the but with the numbers and the four buttons plus centre one with teletext .\nA : so we're suggesting doing sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?\nC : ye no it's not it's just four buttons that are on cross , so that you ba can control all of the important tasks from that alone .\nB : that's not scroll wheel .\nB : instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter .\nC : so we we go mid-sized , so something looks good and is not too prone to get lost .\nC : that be it .\nA : so on to functional requirements or trend watching ?\nB : trend watching has later date there .\nD : trend watching believe .\nA : forty six nineteen fifty seven .\nD : see what it looks like .\nD : it's been so long .\nD : what to say .\nD : when when see the when see the product don't wanna buy it .\nD : see so many of out there .\nD : there's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there .\nB : are you talking about the picture ?\nB : that's not our that's not our design , that's just that's just something he graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like .\nD : 'cause 'cause now don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have product to market yet .\nD : and from from talking to mike is that we have we have we can market more expensive product now .\nD : that's what understand so , hello .\nA : upper management said yes .\nA : excuse that , that's bit of spam .\nD : and and so i'm i'm little bit stuck now in that what what is it that i'm gonna market ?\nD : without special or increased marketable features don't believe the product has consumer demand .\nD : like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price now .\nD : what are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ?\nB : what's special and unique about scroll ?\nD : don't it's see it as different .\nD : don't say it's specially don't say it's special .\nD : say that it's different what i'm looking for as marketing is give me something different .\nD : give me lower price , give me higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's at the same price .\nD : need something to market about this thing .\nD : we're we're new firm .\nA : i'd i'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as , but wi with similar .\nD : what if when when we have when we when we have something like the cradle or give that's as as marketing standard need something to market , to make this product unique .\nB : the two big points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having the the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell with plastic interior , having it look really and also be really durable .\nD : just remember when made up this report didn't have the information that we're discussing here .\nD : and and so so when we have cradle , when we have some design , so what i'm saying is , from my perspective , don't have product to market now .\nD : my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology .\nD : that's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase .\nD : and so we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability .\nD : again i'm not sold on the product because we don't have product in my opinion yet .\nD : so need product .\nB : let's get product then .\nD : need product to market .\nD : and whatever product you put together , we'll find way to market it .\nD : tha that i'm not concerned with .\nA : so now so our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ?\nD : if you if you give me if you give me cut-out of what everybody else has then need to need to find lower cost .\nA : do we go basic or do we go for features ?\nA : does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?\nB : my question is what would the scroll wheel do ?\nB : function-wise , what does that do that .\nA : but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ?\nD : wh wh what's the wh now what see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons .\nB : t's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .\nC : but would we .\nD : so from marketing standpoint have have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique .\nD : if it creates something more complex or more expensive , then if that makes it marketing necessity .\nD : but again , from marketing perspective want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's very competitive market .\nA : what understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make .\nB : they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , , it it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales it's worth it to do it , but would just use if was gonna do this would just use the scroll wheel for channels up and channels down .\nA : so like the idea of focusing the my personal preference is focusing the the product on the idea of the the case the the dock to put it in to to charge it .\nB : don't think volume or do you think volume would be no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but .\nC : i'll bet first in volume .\nA : we can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .\nA : it makes it easy to market , it's easy to differentiate the product , so .\nA : and if we we keep the rest in format that is durable because the whole product's gonna need to be more durable thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often .\nA : it's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle .\nA : so if we can market it in terms of that and so our big decision then is like how do we do like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on not exactly the details , but do we have what type of casing ?\nD : we got some exclusivity in that , , we got something that nobody else has now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness .\nA : personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .\nB : i'm thinking something like kinda almost like these pens , , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like fused the plastic with rubber on the outside .\nA : just very thin sorta sheet for grip , sorta thing or for .\nB : no ma bit more then is on here but ju just as an inspiration , these pens are are or from from my perspective is mistake because this is universal remote and all you're doing it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not lot of information , , there .\nA : so then if we do we want to do anything more basic with the more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for buttons , or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go ?\nA : do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ?\nC : it's only t_v_ .\nB : it receives no information .\nB : so don't see any reason for having an 'cause it's an increased cost .\nB : unless you can think of something interesting to do with it .\nD : now there's now there's nothing coming out of the t_v_ to receive , so unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the cable box there's no don't see the , don't see the necessity of an either .\nD : don't see it .\nA : so the question is now we need to decide on you have to now go and figure out the details of this thing .\nA : so , what we need to terms of marketing and project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you can go and build this ?\nA : what what overall things have we not decided on ?\nB : have to for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be .\nB : there's the scroll wheel , in or out ?\nB : what do you like in the user interface ?\nA : in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of difference to justify the cost ?\nD : it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , believe , for me to market .\nD : again the push-buttons see are are everywhere .\nD : and so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in in broader market than if we go with something unique .\nD : the other thing about was , do we go to something like this ?\nD : make remote that doesn't look like remote .\nD : it's just another it's just an idea , and what see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and .\nB : dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because , as far as durability it's not big when it's closed .\nD : this and what keep throwing out there keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .\nD : but you are the ones that have to ultimately create the product within cost .\nA : and the question that you're being asked now is whether is the dock enough of unique feature to be able to go out and sell that as very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as ?\nA : because the scroll wheel comes at quite cost .\nD : you gotta get into cost effectiveness .\nD : if you can have the base station with with locator , those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without bunch of extra cost .\nB : the the locator's gonna require radio transmitter , which will we're probably gonna have to go with like medium chip , would imagine .\nA : that's gonna is that gonna need better chip as ?\nC : no it's just different .\nB : but we we will need receiver , an antenna .\nD : so it's just that's know personally that would be very attractive feature , is to have have button push to find my remote control .\nB : it should be really simple signal though so that's true .\nA : and it's presumably gonna need little speaker in it like that as to beep .\nA : but little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need quality , is it ?\nA : it's makes your living room more fresh as you watch .\nB : it'll be really cheap .\nD : or you can like have smell-o-rama , you push button and it puts out stink .\nA : we're doing for time here .\nA : we've got about another ten minutes .\nA : that pr my personal preference is out .\nB : so the scroll wheel , in or out ?\nA : don't think the cost is justified for little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and don't t's obvious and natural how it would be used .\nC : we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it it breaks down easier .\nB : for me the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad .\nB : exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but he does have point , it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels .\nB : it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that .\nA : but then that that surely depends little on the t_v_ because some t_v_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got scroll wheel and you you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the t_v_'s ability to to change channels .\nA : or do you have to go through and you for it ?\nA : you scroll it bunch of times and you for it to .\nB : wh what it would be is like like the like this , where it's digital wheel , , where it's where it's quantized into certain that was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be .\nA : that's where you see see what you're talking about now .\nB : it's just it's it it's just look and feel thing .\nB : it has the same exact functionality as two buttons .\nD : there's that there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , and see the scroll as as mechanism for surfing .\nD : instead of going button-to-bu you just you'd .\nA : if you're just sitting there going that's kinda actually .\nD : really really think that's really thing for surfing .\nB : now just just so though you did bring up point which is very valid , is lot of t_v_s won't re the t_v_s won't respond exactly the same .\nB : some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip .\nA : you could make it so that it'll it's just gonna be sending signal to the t_v_ the t_v_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once .\nA : if you do that .\nB : it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , but once people get used to it do like the idea of the scroll wheel though .\nA : other than click click click .\nA : and if we're marketing it as high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good t_v_s as , , presumably .\nD : now the the only thing on the interface side of it , is that see the dilemma .\nD : but if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , .\nD : so go presuming have , on my television , something that tells me what channel i'm on , scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two .\nD : because it's on the television .\nD : the television tells me what channel it's on when change it .\nD : so that really that's that's gonna be problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of button .\nD : so ca can we can we create that interface within scroll system ?\nD : you understand what i'm saying ?\nB : you might be getting at , or or , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , and it it why ?\nA : see so if if we had an up the top that just did number on it , ?\nD : no we could read it from the television .\nA : and then it that .\nA : you'd need display on the the thing .\nB : it'll tell you when you flip the channel on the t_v_ .\nD : the the television can tell you .\nA : no see what you're talking about .\nA : how would you program it though ?\nB : you just it's one extra button .\nB : you say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you'll still have the keypad where you can type in manually .\nD : put and then .\nB : so programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end .\nA : and and that just flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again .\nD : we have another another marketing tool .\nD : we have about three we have three or four things here .\nA : that's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really .\nA : you could come up with partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply .\nD : and an we even have this as in-house technology .\nD : this may be something that's available through our own through our own services .\nA : might be , but tha that's not gonna be such costly feature .\nA : the problem we're gonna have is making it robust .\nB : also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two .\nA : making it last .\nD : or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other .\nA : so if there's button for each type .\nB : no because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels .\nA : people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they the mode switch .\nD : , then you just have , you have diff you have mode switch .\nB : we'll need we'll need mode switch , but then if we have mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator to which , an l_e_ an l_e_d_ .\nA : just the lights behind the buttons .\nA : you could have back-lit buttons .\nA : would that work ?\nA : is that we have five minutes .\nA : so details that we've talked about here are that we want scroll wheel .\nA : we want mode indicator .\nA : we want back-lit buttons .\nA : and if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that if it's actually pressed or not .\nA : i've seen some remotes do that .\nB : just so it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range .\nB : it seems we're approaching higher-end range .\nB : wanna make everybody's with that .\nD : you had acknowledged that we have more money for this .\nA : we don't have it's not that we have more money , we can push up the the price .\nD : didn't you say so ?\nD : we can increase the cost .\nD : so whether having the design and technology has to come back and say , to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have volume target of of fifty million profit .\nB : wanna make everybody's on board with it .\nA : so we really need to be as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components .\nA : but i'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ?\nA : no that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand .\nA : we're entering new market here , so the the profit expectation for this one product is not as important as being able to but what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ?\nD : i'm i'm with that .\nD : what want to me the next step is for these to come come in with the design proposal with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level .\nB : let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market to replace your t_v_ remote , how much would you pay for that ?\nD : we have to find cost .\nA : but you've gotta think who our target market is because i'm not our target market .\nB : i'm just asking you .\nA : i'm student , but on the other hand would think , with my project manager salary , would could probably afford this would buy it ?\nB : if then you could probably afford this .\nA : if had new t_v_ and this was looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which 's really idea , that would sell me on it little .\nA : do don't 'd go over hundred euro certainly , that would be way too much , but the would be happy paying over forty for it , , but not much .\nB : would say thirty five to forty .\nD : was gonna say thirty five to fifty .\nA : thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket .\nA : so the question is what we ca we make it for .\nD : because one of one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television .\nD : it's one of the marketing features in this .\nA : that's why the scroll needs to be really robust .\nC : so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite , favourite channels , and and with cradle , and and the locator .\nB : with cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons .\nB : and it's gonna look sexy .\nB : it might look like clay .\nC : so you can market pe depending on that ?\nD : bas that's that's easy .\nD : that's that's not , it's .\nD : 'cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone .\nD : under the title of uniquenesses .\nA : the next meeting starts in thirty minutes , although does it ?\nA : it starts at three twenty one , the next meeting .\nA : so we've got more than thirty minutes .\nA : we've got more like fifty .\nD : have is my three twenty one is the next meeting ?\nA : the the ne next meeting is three twenty one .\nD : that's that's almost fifty minutes .\nA : they've they've changed the times from the presentations .\nD : you can you you can create all kinds of things .\nB : we'll let when we're done , if we can go earlier .\nA : so you will be getting your modelling done now and are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in lot of detail ?\nB : if we have any questions we'll just email you .\nC : it everything's covered .\nA : this one was quite easy .\nC : coulda been worse .\nA : always the optimist .\nD : don't have any emails .\nD : this means go home .\nD : we all leave ."], ["<t>

.\nB : put on your mic .\nC : so you forgot how this works again ?\nA : so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ?\nA : and here's the agenda for this meeting .\nA : i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards .\nA : you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .\nA : and then we're gonna evaluate it .\nA : then we're gonna talk about finance , and i've got lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in the last five minutes for this .\nD : bra that's that's like it .\nC : you knocked it up ?\nA : and we're gonna evaluate the product and close .\nA : got forty minutes to do this in .\nA : we should be fine .\nA : let's try and keep this one on schedule .\nA : so your thing is in where is it ?\nC : thi third third third .\nA : is it in who wants it ?\nB : three , three .\nC : the end product thingy .\nB : pedro can have it .\nB : like i'll help talk .\nC : so what we ended up with .\nC : production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and the research department , which is us , is fifteen point eight euros , someone forgot the units there , unit price unit production price cost thing .\nC : we implemented the basic functions , which is just t_v_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for the the channels , and we implemented the the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .\nA : zapping your favourite channels , ?\nB : scrolling through your favourites list .\nC : it's just portuguese thing .\nC : and that was the result .\nA : like the the the the logo on there as .\nB : it's very prominent .\nA : it is very prominent .\nA : so this is the .\nB : so here i'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself .\nB : so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , and then the volume controls are here and here .\nB : you've got the keypad which is the numbers from zero to nine and then ten .\nB : this is the power button .\nB : we have our we have the enter button and what was the other button here ?\nB : this is the teletext .\nC : start the the start to to to programme .\nB : the programme button , the programme button .\nB : so this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your the the type of television you wanna use .\nB : so the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like rubber covering .\nB : so you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it that might be possible mi possible problem , but if you drop it .\nA : is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?\nA : it depends on the stiffness little of it .\nB : and it depends on if it's sliding , but it's pretty ergonomic .\nB : you can feel it .\nA : take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as .\nB : this is clay .\nA : you have to reach little bit don't you .\nB : the the power button is bit of reach , but we might scale down the final model bit .\nA : that wouldn't make sense .\nB : these this is bit larger than it would be , but pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability .\nC : don't have no one to handle that .\nA : and hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective ?\nD : you gave me more than was asking for , so i'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this .\nD : good good good job .\nC : so you ha you have like the the base station with the little button for the where's my remote .\nB : beep beep beep .\nD : pla i'm ha it's .\nC : the locator function .\nB : beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up .\nA : so let me get it , if press this button see .\nC : wicked isn't it ?\nD : so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town , see that .\nB : beep beep beep .\nA : plan to do that as .\nB : no no no tha that's alri exactly that's exactly what those are for .\nA : so the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ?\nB : and there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there .\nA : it's the shape isn't it ?\nB : and we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so .\nA : but if you had trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides .\nB : so in final design phase we might tweak that little bit , but .\nA : but it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as based on that , hasn't it ?\nA : so is that the the final colour scheme as or ?\nB : no this is just what we had to work with at the time .\nB : so we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .\nA : it came off .\nA : the scroll wheels , problem with them not being don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore .\nD : my my my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .\nD : some blend of silvers and blacks .\nB : beep beep beep .\nA : enough of that .\nA : so are we done with the this presentation ?\nD : so you're not gonna find my my folder up there gotta do mine up at the board .\nD : so no it's not in there because had the computer problem and cou couldn't create it .\nA : can not get your get at from your shared folder now ?\nD : couldn't create it in the powerpoint , and i've got this really strange cable .\nD : so what had , going from the powerpoint format , is that like this lot .\nD : is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to changing situations in the in the meeting room ?\nD : so what we had is we had the method .\nD : that's not how you spell method , is it ?\nD : so this doesn't go so fast this way .\nD : and when speak about method speak about the marketing of the product .\nD : and to me with this product we got we got three things to market .\nD : we've got the features , we have the characteristics , and we have the what we would call the other part what we call the the the corp corporate help me .\nD : the the corporation stands behind the product , .\nD : so the features we got the scroll , we've got the the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , we've got the features that make this unique product .\nC : it fell off .\nB : beep beep beep .\nD : the characteristics talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally sensitive .\nD : and the corporation , we're talking about we're we're new we're new company .\nD : we're wanting to make name for ourself .\nD : we're wanting you to find our product so we're gonna give you good product at fair price .\nD : one thing would want to to see is is can we can we get lifetime guarantee on this product , normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ?\nD : that was something would be interested in .\nD : so without going into details , we have we have product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , believe , to make it marketable believe at cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros .\nD : we're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have market niche .\nD : that that would be that would be decision best made by corporate for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .\nA : do you would you argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?\nD : but i'm sh i'm open to to market this in either direction .\nD : but you came up with product , and at that cost it there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together .\nD : the only limitations see to this is that we're focused on television only .\nD : that's the only that's the only drawback see to this .\nD : but with all of these other features people one thing i'm i'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice .\nD : there's gonna be somebody going home and say sh this thing doesn't work for my d_v_d_ and my but like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back .\nA : and we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ?\nA : there's no fundamentally different technology to do that .\nD : one of one of the thoughts that had is can can this unit be be produced in way that makes it upgradable ?\nD : like like sim card in in in telephone .\nD : is there card in can we make card and so after , but you follow what i'm i'm 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea had .\nC : we need we need we need some more buttons if it would to work on some other , but we we we could get another version of it that actually works .\nC : but very co very colf colourful .\nD : to me the only additions .\nA : the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as , or making it less because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look the buttons , what they do , it's very simple , and it just works .\nA : there's risk of that .\nD : but anyway that's .\nA : so we can talk about finance now .\nA : so have little spreadsheet for us where was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight euros , was wondering how you came up with that figure ?\nB : that was just just our technical team added up the production costs of the individual units .\nA : so have bit of spreadsheet here for this .\nA : now i've made few assumptions here in that i'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for cost of four euros , equivalent to solar cells , which is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already .\nA : and i'm assuming that the locator beacon , the the can be made for it sounded different that time can be made for similar price to an l_c_ display , an do you think that's fair coming from the manufacturing ?\nC : beep beep beep .\nB : do think we that we we don't need the events chip on print , we only need the the regular chip on print , so there may have been miscalculation in there .\nA : so we're down to sixteen point four , .\nB : and we and we have single-curved that it's single-curved , .\nA : is that single-curved rather than double-curved ?\nA : we're not entirely what single-curve versus double-cur you think ?\nD : we've got we've got curve and droop .\nA : but we save one euro that way , ?\nA : so we come bring it down to fifteen point four .\nB : see it's little bit more than single-curved .\nB : so it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it .\nA : do don't speak so it's in here , in that do we have any we have special form don't we ?\nA : but the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though don't if we're going for greys and silvers then don't think we're so we're push-button , scroll wheel , we're we have is this intended to be button as or just scroll ?\nB : it's that's not very special , it's pretty if .\nC : we don't it's scroll .\nA : it's not one of the scrolls where , , with this one you could push it down to be button ?\nB : no we just use it as scroll .\nA : then we have fifteen point eight euros .\nB : it was pretty accurate estimate would say .\nA : it wasn't bad .\nA : so we're on to the we're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have look at the criterias that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell how's it going ?\nB : 's frighteningly accurate .\nA : anyone got any thoughts ?\nA : how how have we done today ?\nB : we did pretty .\nA : we did pretty too .\nA : that looks pretty spectacular .\nD : no , we come up with with attractive marketable product and and concept .\nA : any other chang thoughts ?\nA : so what about room for creativity ?\nA : is it the .\nB : sh there was plenty of room .\nA : we we ended up being quite creative there .\nB : we got couple innovative couple innovative ideas .\nD : we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we we still have the the teletext capability in this thing , we raised the price of it , we've added two new technology to it .\nD : so if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us .\nA : not every idea necessarily , it's still remote control .\nA : no but we did we did break with the specs little bit , but the leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ?\nD : but like when say we have we had believe we have room for creativity 'cause this is we did it .\nA : no they were reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing .\nC : it was more of teamwork thing then really leadership based project was teamwork .\nB : there was lot of synergy .\nA : teamwork , he is .\nA : what did we think of the meeting room , is an important thing here .\nB : these cables suck .\nA : this falls off and the white board worked really without any pro , lapel .\nC : and that's you must have very long shirts .\nC : that's way far down lapel mic .\nA : wha , , alright .\nC : lapel lapel lapel .\nC : that's almost crotch mi cr dear dear .\nA : that's it's down , it's quite close .\nD : what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting new ideas for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta .\nA : keep it , keep it calm .\nA : no more pizza for me .\nA : so the the pen came in alright and it's little uncomfortable to use but it works .\nC : 'cause this is you were using it upside down .\nC : still that use them like that .\nB : that's our boss .\nA : nah , i'm i'm not convinced of that .\nA : i've been wor i've been wondering about day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down .\nA : so that data might be slightly invalid .\nA : what new ideas have we found ?\nB : wel had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the remote call feature .\nA : let's do both then .\nA : for the product ?\nA : we came up with quite bit .\nC : bunch of new ideas .\nA : and for the meeting room , has anyone got any more less sore on the ears .\nC : comfortable headsets would be .\nD : clearly remote control microphones would be the would be solution to all these cables , but i'm that there's there's some justification for these things that about .\nD : and did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon .\nD : it's not been it's not been cooperating so , but don't think that's the that's avoidable .\nC : coulda been worse .\nA : so are the costs within the budget ?\nA : hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty euros .\nA : no requirements are changed .\nA : we're still under twenty euros to build , so we're good .\nA : and the costs within the budget ?\nA : not the original budget , but they are now .\nA : is the project evaluated ?\nA : so , then celebration as it says .\nC : free coke provided at the cafeteria .\nA : how that got there .\nC : who wrote that one ?\nD : so we need to close this meeting , bravo .\nD : i've got lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and .\nA : i've got lot of paperwork to catch up on too ."], ["<t> The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce. </t>

so we can start ?\nA : suppose have to do my presentation .\nA : so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager .\nC : it's ada longmund ?\nA : so we will have to speak about the project .\nA : our project project is to create new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\nA : so the project method is the following .\nA : so if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other .\nA : it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .\nA : the tool training is to try out the white board , so you can draw your favourite animal and make list of its favourite characteristics .\nC : someone ha we have to this whiteboard , ?\nA : if we have to do it now , later later .\nB : so you can do it .\nA : so the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros .\nB : twenty five euros ?\nA : it's quite good price , .\nC : it's it's reasonable , quite .\nD : it's reasonable , , .\nA : and it will be an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes .\nA : so , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your with the remote control .\nA : just be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy .\nA : and and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and suppose what you have to do .\nA : and you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .\nC : hope so i_d_ is for the industrial design , ?\nD : those things just refer to each of each of us , .\nA : so so will manage all all the group .\nC : and u_i_d_ , it's for the user interface designer , ?\nD : and marketing expert , it's me .\nC : you will be the manager .\nD : you can manage all this , .\nA : so you have questions ?\nA : so you all the parts of the work you have to do .\nD : so which you , the industrial designer .\nB : no i'm user interf i'm user interface design .\nC : am the industrial design , am the industrial designer so .\nB : so what's the difference between user interface design industrial design ?\nD : you have to know .\nD : you have to .\nD : it's your job , so hope you what it is .\nC : so the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will the relation between the user and the remote control so and the industrial design , it is how the object will look like .\nA : suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .\nB : so make user interface .\nB : you you de you implement the core functions in the use it .\nA : and you will transform it .\nB : industrial design's , it's the function design .\nC : so the materi .\nB : design the user user interface , you design the function .\nA : it is the outside and the inside .\nC : but was thinking that he's user 'cause the user interface to design where the but button will be , .\nC : i'm the industrial designer .\nD : not the other one .\nC : so and the marketing expert will .\nD : i'm just go i'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would converged to the user interface designer wi and then industrial designer .\nA : and when designing the remote control just remember that it has to be international product .\nA : so you don't have to do something really specific , as everybody everybody will have to use it , it's sor the same as keyboards .\nA : you have qwerty , azerty , french and u_k_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international .\nA : and not too expensive .\nA : as we want to maximise the benefit .\nB : and easy to use .\nD : and you have to keep it under twelve euros and fifty , so .\nA : you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty euros .\nD : that's the problem .\nC : it should be there was step about drawing something in the in the board , .\nA : and to be that really people will be interested in buying new remote control with new functionalities that don't exist in the existing remote controls now .\nA : so , is it ?\nD : should go and draw an animal .\nC : are we supposed to do now ?\nC : it's it's from the left to the ri it's was thinking but i'm not now .\nA : so you think we have to do it now ?\nB : you can draw something which is very simple .\nC : everybody everybody should do it , so .\nA : you want me to draw something ?\nA : product manager , let's go , will try .\nB : we should bring kemy here .\nB : kemy is really good at drawing .\nC : it's not matter so .\nB : you're going to draw ?\nD : it's the same as mine .\nC : it's it's cat .\nB : it's fat cat .\nC : it is not fat cat .\nD : it's the fat cat , .\nC : it is yes you have to draw rat if you want rat .\nB : can you draw rabbit ?\nB : hat ha rat .\nA : mouse is not too difficult .\nC : it's your rat .\nD : just go , you you the closest to the whiteboard .\nC : go , but in grow , it's everybody has to grow what are you don no idea , so it's rabbit .\nB : the only thing draw is like this .\nA : you love the eyes .\nA : that was the eyes .\nD : bugs bunny one .\nC : it's not so bad so .\nB : the only thing draw , because it's very simple .\nD : so what else ?\nD : this was my favourite one , but .\nC : so you don't have fish .\nC : that's that's fish ?\nC : let's try to draw something .\nA : you forgot the chips .\nD : doesn't look so fine .\nC : have to be really careful .\nA : fish and chips .\nD : it's your turn .\nC : it's my turn .\nB : no problem , no problem .\nC : it's so , what can draw some more ?\nC : it's it's se it's my priority this one .\nC : it's really crazy dog .\nC : it's dog in village .\nC : so what are you sug going to do now ?\nA : just have to present project , discuss little bit about it .\nB : so we have break .\nD : we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .\nA : so , if you have questions .\nD : time is it ?\nC : we have an idea .\nC : have an idea of my job so so ."], ["<t> The User Interface Designer discussed  some characteristics and functions to consider in designing the remote and

secretary .\nC : as also program ma manager .\nC : so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ?\nC : and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after .\nC : so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer .\nC : so you're participant two ?\nD : no no no .\nC : no you're no , i'm participant one .\nB : three three , it's three .\nC : did you save your presentation ?\nB : in one , .\nC : isn't that technical functions ?\nB : so you didn't save it .\nA : it's david jordan .\nB : alright , so david jordan ?\nC : so so i'll let david jordan do his presentation .\nA : no , no .\nA : this one doesn't want to be moved , .\nB : too for email then .\nD : the first will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote t_v_ control .\nD : will focus on user interface design .\nD : so move to the next slide .\nD : as we know our remote rem remote t_v_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .\nD : there's lot of functions .\nD : over , over twelve or twenty functions of remote t_v_ control .\nD : so how can we design user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?\nD : let's move to next slide .\nD : so so we want to design elegant , easy to use inter interface .\nD : very good example is google .\nD : as we know google it's very successful because his powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .\nD : so move to next slide .\nD : so my job is to design google t_v_ controller which want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .\nD : so that's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .\nC : so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .\nD : with sophisticated functions , but with very powerful .\nC : so powerful , many functions and very easy to use .\nA : so , , it's difficult to have both , the the one on the doesn't look so simple and .\nB : to merge the two system .\nC : you mean this one ?\nC : you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , suppose .\nB : but but this is .\nD : but if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it .\nB : you you have some international standards , where , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign .\nC : you mean for the pic pictograms or things like that ?\nB : here , escape , , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , that it should be the same .\nA : it should , .\nB : so you have to the sh the user there the power off button it is something very international , that so .\nA : the user should know .\nC : such as the go on , go back and so , you will propose us something which is so powerful and easy to use .\nB : but the question is how to merge the google system to the system , alright .\nA : that's gonna be the trick .\nD : that's my job .\nB : that's your job it you , .\nD : that's my job .\nD : it's not the easiest i've got to .\nD : powerful and easy to use .\nA : so that's the point .\nD : that's the point .\nC : so , next propose the industrial user interface to present things .\nC : so you you're .\nB : the rationale must be design , or so we can move to the next slide .\nC : so , baba is the the industrial designer .\nB : as you all know , my job is to design to give an industrial design of the remote control .\nB : so the re the remote control will be , , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device , like this one i'm holding in my hand and the t_v_ .\nB : so , this one is leather bu based but propose nifra infrared base , so so for me that it is better it's bet it's better to control t_v_ so , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , for the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to it's cheaper than laser , so .\nC : so you mean that infrared control is cheap technology ?\nC : do the requirements for the remote control ?\nC : twelve , nearly thirteen , .\nA : what the cost is ?\nB : for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have let's see .\nA : twelve , twelve half .\nB : you can move to the next slide , so .\nB : so the di the differen the findings what you find inside the re the the system here inside it is just , bulb and an infrared bulb , so here the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .\nA : that might just so .\nB : you can go to the next slide .\nB : have some pictures , here .\nB : you have the the bulb , it is blue the blue here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .\nC : what is this ?\nB : this is some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .\nB : but here what wanted to emphasise it is just the bulb and .\nB : so and the next slide , it is the last one it's so it's it should be wire wireless re remote con because , it's easier to manage and because you the the the battery problem can hold will you use battery or the wire to connected you .\nB : or some thing that we can have both , but , at my side prefer wireless .\nB : so if you have some question didn't answer ?\nA : what's the average price of this technology then ?\nB : the avera the average prices that this technology will cost , , around eight euros , so .\nB : or at least , the you'd yes , you can .\nD : so what , the wireless remote control ?\nD : there's wire with remote control ?\nB : it's so so bres you have to decide how how you will , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or it's it's question that we can raise , so .\nB : we can think that , with the wire , , without wire .\nB : we can have both also .\nC : so you think that cable between the remote control and the t_v_ won't be good idea .\nC : no it wou it will be cheaper , may you making solu , but but as industrial designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?\nA : but this is what you would like to ask the user first and don't think the user would be ready to have don't think , , don't think he would , but in sense the wire ?\nD : wireless remote control .\nB : but some pa always want to have , sometime want to have wire because .\nC : i'm just asking you .\nC : do you will be cheaper ?\nB : don't will be too much .\nC : could you answer ?\nB : have to think about the question , , 'cause it's that you can always wha wha with the wire it's cheaper but the wireless it's more practical , so .\nC : but the wireless problem is more the david jordan's problem .\nC : it's more your problem .\nC : mayb you have just to to research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .\nA : that's my job .\nA : that's the now the .\nC : so so just think of the usability .\nB : but , it should be an agreement , , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the graphical user designer , but .\nB : if it is lot cheaper and if you want to reach some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have wireless , it it is question .\nD : design wireless remote control .\nC : just think of the problem .\nC : if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?\nC : it's would be easier to have link between the remote control and the television , .\nA : that's actually one of the point , ?\nA : this you will see in my presentation then .\nC : so will let you to do your presentation , so .\nA : which is participant four .\nA : so just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something else .\nA : we've made study , so could you go to next slide .\nA : for the functional recurrence .\nA : so that's the standard method for marketing , .\nA : we had one hundred subjects , , we observe their remote control use in lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up questionnaire , , and see what was or not for them .\nA : so then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered .\nA : actually seventy five percent of the users find the most remote controls ugly , , so that's , the the look is is bad for them so it's your job , david , .\nC : you mean the loo the look , the outside ?\nB : the look , how it look like .\nA : then eighty percent of users would spend more money actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly .\nA : so this is where we could have , good market , , if people are ready to pay more .\nA : so it's it's interesting information , .\nA : and then , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on .\nA : so we should change this as .\nA : and users are actually zapping lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as .\nA : and , , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .\nA : and this is one of the main point for me .\nA : but i'll come back to it later .\nA : could you go next slide ?\nA : so as you said , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .\nA : so this is from the experiments we've done , so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , .\nA : it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .\nA : and remote control are really bad for r_s_i_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .\nC : what is r_s_i_ ?\nA : r_s_i_ is like , when you're using the same doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .\nA : so , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count .\nA : so last slide .\nA : so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .\nA : if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our concurrent , .\nA : and definitely if it could have less buttons , still the same number of functions , but less buttons , this would definitely be good way of selling more .\nA : so , remember the user is not happy to read the manual .\nC : and just to have an idea , do you think you as the user interface designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you t's possible ?\nD : because we can we can mix several function in one button .\nD : so lets you then you have less buttons .\nC : but do you will be easy to use ?\nD : but i'm not no you you can have switch menu , so you can , so .\nC : because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .\nC : the , but it has to be intuitive .\nD : like for you can you can category the function into several classes .\nD : then for you can have switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this this category of functions .\nC : but , but .\nD : then you you put the switch button , then it switch to another category of functions .\nD : if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your t_v_ and also you can control your recorder .\nB : with look fancy .\nD : so there's different functions , but if you you there's button you can switch between control t_v_ and control your recorder .\nD : so we can has less buttons .\nD : but what i'm not so is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny .\nB : this is question that should be asked to the if you ask the people , the the marketing people .\nD : because different people have different opinion about fancy .\nA : this is something we sh but this was first step and this was the first step , .\nD : because colourful is fancy for some people , but simple and uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so .\nB : the solution is to have many colours of instead of having one grey standard , , .\nC : but it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .\nA : specially distribution , .\nC : if you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .\nA : but this is what we would ask to the users , so .\nD : because , because some people prefer red remote control , some people prefer black remote control .\nC : it will cost little bit more .\nC : and also , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it .\nD : we can have di di we can have several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so .\nA : remember it's twelve euros .\nC : so , we want something fancy , as previously said , florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap lot .\nC : and they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on t_v_ .\nC : so you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with the other members .\nC : so , is it for your presentation ?\nC : nothing else to to add ?\nA : it's done , just .\nA : if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , it would make it .\nC : so so , had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control .\nC : so the first one is that for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's it's is no , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .\nA : lame , or .\nC : so , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for for you your designing , you're not you won't be you won't had buttons to just to manipulate to control the recorder or the garage door or things like that .\nC : it's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that .\nC : we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .\nD : but there's balance between function and the cost .\nC : so it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .\nC : and also we want the image of the real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and the slogan .\nC : that's if you want to buy remote control and if you go in shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that it's our product .\nC : so you will have to use the colour of the product , of the of the of real reaction and also .\nA : so has to be yellow .\nC : as we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be fashion remote control .\nC : fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .\nC : require lot of requirements , but .\nB : for cheap remote control , .\nC : but that's your your job to find something matches .\nB : 'cause what i'm thinking is how will you will connect the t_v_ to internet , so .\nB : this is , but this this mean that your t_v_ would be able to , , connect to internet , , surf the web .\nA : don't t's part of the remote control design anyway .\nC : not , but mayb so .\nA : it's more in browsing .\nD : there's that box in of it .\nD : pi there's that box in the t_v_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your t_v_ .\nD : it's it's not so popular now .\nB : it's pop don't t's popular , so that's the problem so .\nB : you had if you are designing remote control for the global usage , so if people don't have the technology .\nC : so everybody is with the new requirements ?\nD : so so as as for the colour , what what do you think ?\nC : it has to be yellow .\nB : do you think that people like the colour yellow ?\nD : t_v_ remote control ?\nC : you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .\nB : if you have like yellow ribbon here is the double .\nC : why you go it has to be fashion .\nB : or should be .\nB : doesn't need to be completely yellow , but just .\nC : so you have to .\nC : it has to be fashion and really be the image of the society .\nC : just when you enter you say , , it's real reaction .\nC : t's re reaction remote control , so .\nC : and also it has to be attractive , , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control .\nA : regarding the first line , what so we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .\nA : and that's it .\nB : but , but why , nobody's threat to me .\nA : it's already changed for .\nC : it would be simpler .\nC : so will close the meeting , just after that we'll have lunch break .\nC : and you will have in thirty minutes individual work .\nC : you you will have as the i_d_ don't remember what is industr industrial designer to put pon , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .\nB : industrial designer , .\nB : component component , .\nC : and florent to work my subject .\nC : and so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nC : the session is closed .\nC : and by the way , mister david jordan , record your presentations in your own folder .\nC : not in mine .\nC : should be better ."], ["<t> The User Interface Designer presented three different

on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision .\nA : so will first what ?\nD : no you do the minutes first , or ?\nA : will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan .\nA : so , we'll technical accessoire ?\nC : no no no .\nC : so first will present the concept of user interface .\nC : there's three concepts in the user interface .\nC : so first one it's google controller .\nC : the second is fancy controller .\nC : the last one is intelligent controller .\nC : so there are three concepts in our controller .\nC : next will explain one by one , the first is google controller .\nC : so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions .\nC : so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions .\nC : this is first concept of our controller .\nC : the second concept is fancy controller , so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among lot of products , so so the the user the the user interface should be very very cute , very very attractive .\nC : such like this , there are several examples in the slides .\nA : i'm not the one in the middle is very attractive .\nC : it's very , if you're .\nA : it's very big , .\nC : it's hard it's easy for you to remember it .\nC : or to recognise it , .\nA : we'll have big discussion suppose after that , so .\nC : so the last concept is intelligent .\nC : we want we want our controller to be smart , so we should use technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition .\nC : with this advanced features we we can attract lot of user .\nC : there this is the three concepts of our controller .\nA : have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap to zap between channels .\nC : so some time it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .\nA : do you think they will be able to use gestures ?\nA : because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , they will get injuries because of that ?\nA : or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , they will be bored after while .\nC : if you cannot find your controller , you can just just just speak something such as , , one two .\nB : that's good that's good point , so .\nA : but suppose you got cold .\nA : you have mute remote controller .\nC : so you can use your gesture .\nC : that's no problem .\nD : but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?\nC : for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very .\nA : but suppose you have family watching t_v_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you will work ?\nA : everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?\nD : but this this but this would never happen anyway .\nC : they cannot speak at the same time .\nD : but the but this .\nA : if you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite t_v_ programme , so they say channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , so .\nB : but but the same can happen even with it this remote control because the .\nC : it's very interesting .\nD : don't , , , you mean it could be problem for this .\nA : but you have the remote control , so you can keep it with you .\nA : you're not you're not obliged to share it .\nC : that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller .\nC : even you you have the controller , say channel three , so it's come to channel three , don't have to it's advantage .\nB : it's it's and mayb we can have the switching mode to pass from voice controller to manual controllers , .\nD : no , but this is disadvant disadvantage .\nA : but one other question .\nA : how how much will it cost ?\nB : no , more expensive .\nA : because suppose we need to do research to have something working .\nC : no no we we we we just are use no no we just have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .\nD : if you if if you use the basic but it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built .\nA : some some efficient .\nA : so you won't cost an not lot for us ?\nC : it's because this technology is for limited wor or limited wor lexical recognition , it's very it's .\nC : it's no it's even for the because the the vocabulary the the vocabulary is very small , so that's not problem .\nD : because then you need this doesn't have the power to do recognition , .\nB : you have also the language problem , when you 'cause it it have to be universal , so .\nA : agree with , but there is one problem that baba talked about is the international remote control .\nA : we need something that is international .\nA : suppose we're we want to sell it in france .\nA : the recognition system will be able to understand french .\nA : if you want to go to england , it will be able to understand english , so .\nC : the key , the key the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some adaptation mechanism .\nD : this could be downloaded by the web , or .\nB : the product the pro it's very smart , it's very smart controller .\nC : it's it's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it's can recognise chinese .\nC : it's if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french .\nC : it's because of this product this technology has already been developed .\nA : and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?\nB : but but the problem is how to if this is push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .\nA : but how will you .\nB : if you have the language , you have to develop for each country .\nC : tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .\nB : but for each country you have to do one , because the for se really ?\nC : even for each for even for different family we have to do we would we have to do adaptation to no , it's not so complex .\nB : that's comple microphone .\nD : but then , we have to take care of the twelve euros problem .\nA : seems to be quite complex .\nA : and what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?\nA : and where will be they ?\nA : do you we're far from television it will work ?\nC : no no no it's not that's that's not problem because you you don't have to wear microphone .\nC : it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller .\nA : but where is the controller ?\nC : where is the controller ?\nC : it's in your family , in your home .\nD : no , but then it's it's like this .\nA : but we're here it's an object .\nA : but here you say you want to use technology .\nC : you can you can embed it microphone here .\nA : but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have remote control li like this , if you have an object .\nA : if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .\nB : to talk to the to the t_v_ .\nA : you just want to interact with television .\nC : just you just put the controller here , then you you use your command and you do your gesture .\nB : if you say one , he switch to channel , .\nA : but you can lose it .\nC : no no it's if you lose it .\nB : so if it is somewhere in the room if if it is in the table there you can always say channel one and the the remote control gives the order to the t_v_ to switch to channel one .\nA : you so you can build black box and put it on t_v_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .\nB : but so you need camera and microphone inside your remote control .\nD : but you would still have the buttons .\nD : or is it do you should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ?\nD : or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?\nC : it we should give the flexibility to the user and we .\nC : you can see they can switch form one modality to another .\nD : it's bit risky risky .\nC : no , that's quite inter quite attractive .\nA : and it will be quite .\nB : but that , , switching from one country to to another will be problem , so although but , we should .\nC : if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .\nC : we should have confidence in technology .\nA : so , what do you think ?\nA : we'll try the controllers you'd prefer .\nA : which controller would you prefer to use , you as remote control user ?\nD : if if , i'm if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .\nC : more features , .\nD : but if if if it like doubles no one would would be interested .\nB : but he need control that is very reliable , so .\nA : so it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or fancy controller .\nA : try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller ?\nA : just want to have something controller which is in intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .\nC : but if if you stick to stick to the first two parts .\nA : you t's possible ?\nC : so what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?\nC : there's no features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?\nD : no , no , but you need you need new remote controller then .\nC : would would you replace your controller with controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that , you that's fun that's not the function of the controller , that's function of t_v_ .\nB : it's not really the we we can add some function like for browsing in internet , so like that .\nB : but user need don't have the the if we can send email from it .\nC : you can replace your t_v_ with new t_v_ with internet browsing function , but .\nD : because if you wanna browse internet or , , if you wanna type something , or no .\nC : but it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the t_v_ .\nB : because the the problem see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in family if and for all the person of the family , so , .\nC : but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .\nA : but we want so , but we we want something that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .\nD : you wou you would true .\nC : that's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's feature to distinguish our product from our from other products .\nC : , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?\nA : you don't need to tune it .\nD : the goo you say we would we would to have google-like controller .\nA : if it's not too expensive too .\nB : because you have new ye .\nD : don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google .\nD : google is is simple , works fine , so if can have remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already lot .\nC : yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .\nD : thi this , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .\nC : the then nn no .\nC : tha but the there's there's there's not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .\nD : see that's the problem , .\nC : that's the same .\nD : t's more interesting to develop remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .\nD : but you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so .\nD : that's the point .\nA : so let's go to the industrial designer .\nA : we'll be able to take decision after that , so .\nB : participant two , working design , so .\nB : so can you go to the next one ?\nB : it's not this one .\nB : it's oth the oth so it's the working design .\nA : it's there's something wrong with your you you record it somewhere else .\nB : so this so this is the described use what ?\nB : are you inst don't .\nC : it did didn't receive it .\nC : didn't receive it .\nB : record recorded directly on the computer .\nA : it seems that we have problem with the , so no , it will be more interesting to start with .\nD : if you remember what you had to say or it's more interesting what he says , .\nB : say it to you without .\nC : we can first come to to frahan .\nC : with frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later .\nA : you will had some more information in it will be interesting after your presentation to have baba's presentation .\nB : , because in my presentation don't have here with so it was the design use to show you the design of what is inside what is inside and what are the different component of the of the remote control .\nB : so it will be interesting so could show you some some picture of what is inside and so .\nB : so the the something want to discuss is which material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or plastic remote control like this one .\nB : so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like where , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , , you can see them in the darkness .\nB : and the other thing want to discuss also is which alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be solar energy alimentation or will it be battery like the classical battery so .\nB : and that for the alimentation it would be good to have both of them , so so in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , , the cities in some place in in senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , .\nA : it's an added value to the remote control and it can attract all the ecological consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , no ?\nB : ecologists , , , , , .\nB : alrigh , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , so .\nA : and what tha what about the materials ?\nB : and the materials , it depends you if you have wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but , , something wooden will be like , high cl so special high class , or , you can have some , even if it is not completely wood , but just part of the , , will be wooden , in wood and it can be interesting .\nA : and if you we want to put fashion in electronics we can try to do something with wood .\nA : seems to be interesting , .\nB : and so the last point is also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but that low level will be , , it is an interim module .\nA : we want something easy to use and so something very low level wou would be enough .\nA : and you think that we will be .\nB : it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve euros , so .\nA : and what about the buttons ?\nB : the buttons pr prefer , , the lighted buttons because , , it's , in the dark , it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or if you want to watch t_v_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , in the darkness it's very easy so , .\nA : no it's fashion , .\nD : what about the touch scr touch screen ?\nD : it's it's expensive .\nB : touch screen will be as expensive as the buttons so .\nB : but and it is other design , .\nB : it can also be interesting to have this .\nC : so you got email ?\nA : we have only five minutes left .\nD : no , trend watching .\nD : the other one .\nD : so , just , so just to meet the user requirements would just do short anal analysis of the remote control market and to have better overview of what's the fashion in general i've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .\nD : so again , it's similar to what i've said in the previous meeting .\nD : user really really want fancy look and feel .\nD : they're not so so interested in functional look and feel , .\nD : like the one you've shown , david , with all the buttons and it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and so , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so it's related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .\nD : at the same time , it's important that it's easy to use .\nD : so that were the three first points from the remote control analysis .\nD : now if we look at fashion in general .\nD : wha what we really see this year is that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , , so we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .\nD : 'cause it's it's really what people want .\nD : even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .\nD : and then if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on score of seven would have six as importance .\nD : the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three .\nD : then easy to use it's not so important actually with respect to other other ones .\nD : so we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion from milan and paris we go to the fruits and vede vegetables .\nB : and fruit and vegetables .\nD : and the other point haven't mention is people wan want to have spongy touch , so this is this doesn't really fit with the wooden design .\nB : but the problem is which material do you need to to be spongy ?\nD : thi this is this would be like plastic-like , but rubber , mayb , , rubber-like device , so , tha tha that was the main point , , from the trend in fashion .\nB : pla very , rubber rubber desi , .\nA : so we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy .\nA : so , as you say you want something technologically innovative , using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , will attract pro-ecology consumers .\nD : so when it's .\nB : it will be .\nA : cheap imprint so you you propose low level chips would be enough to have something working .\nA : so you think case .\nA : someth no wood .\nB : no wood but plastic ?\nD : not no wood , but ma not the part you touching .\nB : would some we can have wood in the bottom and , .\nA : you it's it's natural .\nB : it depends on the design we want , so .\nB : it's natural and and it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , , saying that it's ecol , , it's not , so .\nA : the feeling is natural , so we can stay with wood .\nD : it's not exactly for the spongy point of view .\nA : but it's still fashion .\nD : but we could have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or .\nA : something that you can into it .\nA : and what about the user interface concept ?\nB : google and and fancy , how about the the voice ?\nA : google and fancy ?\nA : because that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .\nB : and we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how it it is an an interesting concept to see to have voice control .\nC : the smart controller .\nB : but and the problem is i'm we can infer if you have voice control why not to put it directly on the the t_v_ , so speak directly to the t_v_ and you don't need remote control actually , so .\nA : but you need receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .\nB : but it will be embedded on the t_v_ and not on the remote control , so .\nA : so we'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller , try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .\nA : for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not too difficult to add .\nB : and pf what can we think supplement to the supplement can be the voice .\nA : for the interface something added value .\nB : it is just , , it is not the most important , but it can be part of , .\nA : you mean the remote control with mur module if you want you can just use commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .\nB : to push button , , .\nB : even it is for just some kids , , switching channels one two three four .\nA : turning the t_v_ on or off .\nB : not very complex commands , but easy commands , so .\nA : so , adding some vocal commands .\nB : simple ones for expensive buttons , to make some new .\nA : so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction .\nA : so you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition .\nA : you will have to work more , baba , on the spongy way to to add spongy touch to the buttons and try to find shape for the wooden remote control .\nA : and sup we'll have to evaluate the product too .\nD : no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .\nA : and remember as as said last meeting , we really have to build fashion remote control and the colour of the the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control .\nB : need it to be , .\nA : so you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us modelling cl clay remote control , so you will have to model model something .\nA : and that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nA : so , no more questions , we can close the session .\nB : sounds good , ."], ["<t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote. </t>  <t> The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom. </t>  <t> The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype. </t>  <t> Overall, the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability. </t>  <t> The team decided that the prototype

really .\nB : i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype .\nA : your judgement it's is biased .\nD : so whe where is the remote control ?\nA : so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting .\nA : so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba .\nA : so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost .\nA : and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production .\nA : so will let the our two designers talk about so their you have , .\nC : that is three .\nB : effectively one slide and we can discuss everything .\nC : so , this is our product or prototype .\nC : this is made by clay .\nC : the basic colour is yellow and red .\nC : yellow is our company colour , red it's is more attractive .\nC : so we used two basic colour , yellow and red .\nC : and the shape , there's two basic shape .\nC : the first is circle and the second is triangle piece .\nC : it's we call it mushroom design .\nC : it's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .\nC : so this is introduction of our product .\nC : next mo , , so next slide .\nA : genetically modified mushroom will say , but keep on speaking .\nC : so there are several key features of our pr prototype .\nC : the first is that it is fuzzy .\nC : i'm this would be the unique design the market .\nC : so it's fuzzy design , and unique design .\nC : and the second key feature is that circle channel selection .\nC : in the traditional key traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have circle , so we can turn this ball to to select channel .\nC : so it's quite convenient for user to use it .\nA : chan , , but don't touch don't destroy your prototype .\nC : the third feature is stable triangle base .\nC : this sta this triangle base is very stable , so so it's it's it's unlikely you cannot found it .\nC : so it's , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button .\nC : you can can you can see the the shape of the buttons is mushroom , so , everything's mushroom .\nA : so we can call our remote control the mushroom .\nC : mush mushroom design , .\nB : but it's not like really mushroom because you have like lemon shape , , centre is yellow and to integrate , .\nC : that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it .\nB : don't hope nobody will eat it .\nB : to integrate the fruit aspect , the the in really ?\nD : because mushroom was not in the trends .\nD : there was fruits .\nA : fruits and vegetables .\nB : but fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was mushroom ?\nA : mushroom is vegetable .\nA : so it's something eatable .\nB : we can it's veg vegetable , but we we integrated them with different colour .\nD : but anyway this is not mushroom anyway , so it's fine .\nB : we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable .\nB : this , , very enlighted colours , .\nD : no , , .\nD : inspira inspiration is true .\nB : and inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so .\nB : and so so what we what add is that , he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , , the chip , it is low level chip , and , we don't need to .\nC : no this our only two slides .\nC : so we cut it to see .\nB : wi the low level chips inside and the button and the the battery it is under .\nC : so where's the battery battery ?\nB : it is in in in the base , .\nA : in the base .\nA : in the basement .\nA : in the basement .\nA : and where is the solar solar cell ?\nD : but we say we sa we said solar .\nA : where is the solar cell ?\nB : this this this this is revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and don't , but it it's might be , so .\nA : do you won't be it won't cris increase the price ?\nA : we'll see after .\nA : we will have first to so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?\nB : it might be .\nD : we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about we had three keys key points to for this remote control design , and first one was fancy look and feel .\nD : so we'll try to judge this feature with one to seven scale , one being no , .\nD : just let me check .\nB : so , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable .\nD : one one being true , and seven being false .\nD : so do we have fancy look and feel , according to you ?\nB : you have colours .\nB : don't the sha the bowl shape people like .\nD : but is it i'll agree it's unique , but is it really , fancy was was defined by fruit and vegetable look .\nC : the shape is unique , and the colour so it depend on how do you define fancy .\nB : is it really fancy ?\nB : but it's you have the lemon aspect of this this this thing .\nA : if you change if you take the buttons out , and do things like that it would be bet more like lemon ?\nB : do don't do that , .\nD : where the lemon is , but it's not obvious .\nB : it's it's this shape is lemon like , so .\nD : if , improving the texture of like having it less smooth or .\nB : because less button .\nC : so , my mush .\nA : looks like more fruit .\nB : but you don't have any button now .\nA : and , you have the finger here , with the buttons ?\nB : that's , is that that's good idea .\nA : it looks more like pineapple .\nA : what's the use for that ?\nC : for turn turn the ball .\nB : have no idea , so .\nC : if you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .\nB : have no idea what if it is fancy or not .\nA : and where is the voice recognition ?\nC : it's embedded , your microphone .\nD : that's that's the second point .\nC : this there's two two functions .\nC : this is microphone array .\nD : first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .\nA : is it better like that ?\nD : no , the colour is , that's fine .\nB : so we can we can say the colour , is the colour acceptable ?\nA : looks , let's say it's pineapple now .\nB : so the shape now .\nD : it's but would say there is more too much red .\nA : it looks like now you took it .\nB : it's too much red ?\nB : in the basement ?\nA : it looks like pineapple with cherry on top .\nD : so , from one to seven ?\nA : seven is the ma the maximum ?\nB : will give will i'll gi i'll give two or three .\nD : no , seven is false and one is true .\nB : three , it's .\nA : three , will say three .\nB : three , three .\nB : three is fine for me .\nA : isn't it bitter like that ?\nD : then let me the other criterion is is it technologically technologically in innovative .\nB : what other is it easy to use ?\nA : you said previously that you there's microphone inside an .\nC : this is microphone array , .\nB : it's micro array , .\nC : there four microphone .\nA : and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?\nC : so they they they they there's microphone array .\nC : so you can capture voice , you , so you can capture voice from different directions .\nA : and you can turn it so it's techno technologically innov innovative ?\nB : and you you've never seen rou round remote control , so it is , but see , you have microphone array embedded .\nD : bu but when you say technologically it's more , in the core , or single .\nA : we have tactile buttons .\nB : you have that's good .\nD : no , that's good .\nB : and you have , this ki this solar receptor that , yes .\nD : that's another really good point .\nB : technically it's acceptable , so .\nD : so using the same scale , two ?\nB : two , , two .\nA : would say two .\nB : it's it's fine , so .\nA : it's better like that , isn't it ?\nD : now the most critical one .\nB : most , for the vocal command yes , it's might be easy .\nD : last one would like to judge is is it easy to use ?\nB : but it's just speaking .\nC : it's very easy .\nB : you just need the command .\nD : but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the .\nC : you can use this in this way .\nC : this is the base .\nC : so you can turn to change the channel .\nD : but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?\nC : you just tu turn .\nB : if you he if you hear some click , it would , that's difficult .\nD : like if you want to go from but imagine you i'm i'm no i'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , , one to twenty ?\nA : you take take the remote , so and you can turn like that to change the channel ?\nA : it's quite easy to so zapping , but it will be too fast .\nD : how can you go directly to twenty , ?\nB : that's dif that's difficult .\nC : no , no , no .\nC : if if it depend on the the angle you turn the if if this is channel one .\nB : but how you need to something that .\nD : but if you're fro from two ?\nC : so it it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .\nA : you have , like that , and so on .\nB : and you you can you can if you have scale , so , it's bit difficult .\nD : ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels we're not talking .\nC : fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree .\nC : so you got how many degree you you it no no , you don't have to no it's when you when you stop when you stop , the the turn , then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you it's it's very easy , because you kn how many channel are there in the , , .\nA : but but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go .\nD : how how do this angle is is the correct one ?\nD : so you you count one degree , two degrees , no .\nC : you can do it .\nC : so so you can do it .\nC : so , you can just change .\nB : but the the vocal command is easy too .\nB : you can say fifty and fifty it's , so , , and that's .\nD : voc vocal command is .\nD : but we've said previously that it's not going to be the main and this would be more for browsing , .\nC : there's also number , .\nA : but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels .\nA : so , when you say want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .\nA : but if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really you want to do , you can turn it .\nA : just go through all the channels and stop if there is something interesting ?\nA : seems to be good .\nA : good choice , mister david jordan .\nB : and but i'd it is turn off turn off button , .\nC : and also you can , if you you ca you can turn this .\nA : what's what's this cherry ?\nC : or you ca you can you can also turn this .\nC : for this you can tune it's for tune .\nC : you you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this .\nC : if you want to from skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this .\nC : it's like fine , from coarse to fine .\nC : this is coarse , this is fine .\nB : that's that's very technologic , so .\nC : so it's coarse to fine design .\nD : the this looks better .\nC : is is this is , from one channel to to ten channel .\nB : but di didn't see where the the turn off turn on turn off button so much activates one of the it's on off , .\nC : this is from one channel to .\nA : you have the vocal commands .\nD : but it has to be on to recognise fas , that's not the ecological part , .\nA : most of the time you have the it's sleeping remote control .\nA : that why we have the solar ti .\nD : so , which number ?\nB : easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , , it's reasonable three .\nA : do you agree ?\nC : agree , agree .\nD : so reasonably , is four , is one ?\nB : three three for me , it's it's .\nD : so , three .\nB : four or three .\nB : you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean .\nA : and what's your opinion ?\nD : we wouldn't say , , those are but this one would be more five to me .\nB : will you give four ?\nD : i'd like this is the just prototype .\nD : i'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but .\nB : so if but you just push two button , zero and and one .\nC : what do what you compare with traditional tr traditional controller ?\nC : it's easier than traditional controller .\nC : if you use traditional controller you have to put button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball .\nC : there's two balls , the smaller the the the so you can you can you can control the scale .\nD : so you have .\nC : but in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ?\nD : by pushing zero after after the first one .\nC : , , you you can do it , but you can also do it in the if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just there's also button here .\nB : and that's are there some buttons ?\nC : this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to the next one , the next sn , the the third one .\nA : it's not what you said previously .\nA : previously you said that turning this was the fine fine to coarse .\nD : if you're changing your mind .\nD : fine to coarse .\nA : and from ten to ten channels here .\nC : one to ten , ten to twelve , ten to twenty .\nC : ten to twenty and this one , one two three four five six , like this .\nC : there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc .\nD : but this this has to stay on the table , ?\nD : this has to stay on the table .\nC : this is just base .\nB : on flat place you can ye yes , .\nC : you can just .\nD : but then when you turn turn it just it's .\nA : no no , no .\nA : you can't put it out .\nA : it's just your turning from the base .\nA : you need to have everything in hand .\nA : if you want to turn , you can't use it and turn .\nA : you need to put it on and turn .\nD : tha that's the weak point , because with traditional one you just have one hand .\nC : you use your so this is next generation controller .\nA : but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i've lost the remote control .\nA : nobody would take it .\nD : you would never you would never lose this one , .\nA : so nobody will lost lose it .\nB : may it's the next prototype , we cou four .\nA : we can change from four ?\nB : four , it's .\nB : i'll put four .\nA : easy to use , four .\nA : gonna say four .\nB : four it's more reasonable .\nD : it's even easier to .\nB : you can you can erase with this er .\nB : four it's more reasonable , so .\nB : so it's nine , nine over three .\nD : so , average ?\nD : so , especially on the easy to use target .\nB : it need some further work , but it's , .\nB : might it might be fine .\nA : so , the project is accepted ?\nA : but that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into pineapple .\nA : if you re we really want to have fruitful remote control .\nB : that's the finance .\nA : and we we had project prototype presentation with the evaluation .\nA : so as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view .\nA : so we need to calculate the production cost .\nA : as said in the first meeting we need to have so remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty euros .\nA : and if not if it's not the case you would have to redesign it .\nA : so , just have look at the here is the excel sheet , so so it has the energy source .\nA : we have hand dynamo .\nA : no , we don't use that .\nA : we have battery , ?\nB : we have battery .\nA : kinetic , we don't have it , suppose , but we have solar cells .\nB : no , solar cells , .\nA : how many do do you need , solar cells ?\nA : do you think one would be enough , or such as as number of branches ?\nB : in each ball you have three three , three , .\nB : three three solar cells .\nA : so , electronic .\nA : single simple chip on print ?\nA : just one would be necessary ?\nB : simple , simple , .\nA : zero for the others .\nA : and sample sensor , sample speaker .\nA : as we have voice recognition , .\nA : so the case .\nB : is it is sh it wooden .\nD : so we are all already nineteen .\nA : just keep on going , just to have an idea .\nC : the solar cell is too expensive .\nB : is yes wooden pl and that's there's no wood , so plastic just only , .\nA : but what what about case ?\nA : uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved .\nA : it's more like double curved .\nD : that's gonna be double curved , .\nB : double curve , , double curve .\nB : one , you have .\nB : but it's , rubber , .\nD : rather four buttons .\nD : no , interface .\nA : do we need special colour ?\nD : that's special colours , .\nA : we have two special colours .\nC : we have four .\nA : we don no .\nA : it it's more like integrated scor .\nB : that this will be like scroll wheel , actually .\nD : tha that's wheel .\nB : you tu you turn you turn it , so , true .\nC : no no no , it .\nA : two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .\nB : scr l_c_ display , .\nA : so , no button supplements ?\nD : the price is .\nA : we we have problem .\nA : we if we keep on adding things so we have to if if suppose if we change and we put just one ?\nD : one of the key point is solar cells .\nA : has it changed .\nB : it was stage one , so .\nD : no it did change , but just imagine we have .\nC : we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip .\nB : so you can transform the wood into plastic , .\nC : we have to delete the the sample sensor , .\nA : but we have you the the voice recognition , no ?\nD : but this one one of the feature we were not really .\nC : it's the one it's we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version .\nC : advanced version we have speak .\nB : because it seems that this can be , wood into plastic and it it should be fine .\nA : or it would be better .\nC : plastic is free .\nA : so , do we need special colour ?\nD : that's one of the requirement .\nA : because we have red .\nB : red and yellow .\nA : red and yellow .\nD : we could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black .\nC : we we can we can we yellow .\nD : black then is regular colour , so .\nA : so we need if we try to have pineapple bee .\nD : so push button then it's it's the next expensive one .\nA : an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button .\nA : and this is one .\nD : thi this might be .\nA : integrated scroll wheel push button .\nA : so we'll we have only one ?\nA : and push button .\nA : so if we have all integrated in the scroll wheel and push button , it's something flat .\nB : remove you have five with push buttons , so we can just , , try to modify some of them to have .\nD : so what's the bottleneck ?\nC : how about we change the sale ?\nB : we can transform the double curve into single .\nB : some single curve .\nD : but flat case , what's the ca and then one euro left .\nB : single curve should be fine , so .\nB : what it's it's bad idea , so .\nC : we have one .\nA : don't bat no battery , only solar cells .\nD : so we have one button , one wheel .\nA : there's problem with the push push button .\nA : we only need just one .\nA : so , you will have so one button , and scroll wheel with push button on it .\nB : one one scroll wheel , so and the vocal chord , it's fine .\nB : it it's fine .\nA : so so , .\nD : it's good they're not charging anything for that .\nA : it think we we've done good job , as the cost is twelve fifty , but it's under or equal .\nC : cou could we have look could we have look at the the the prod the the cost ?\nD : actually it's wrong .\nD : we're not under twelve euros and half .\nA : it's not written .\nA : sometimes it's under or equal .\nB : it's under or equal .\nB : it's fine , so it's fine , twelve fifty the solar cells , is is it ?\nC : so let's say wha what .\nC : which part is the most expensive part ?\nC : it's not cheaper .\nA : but it would be interesting for our marketing team , to make lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .\nB : to be able to si to sell it .\nD : that's argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve .\nB : with mi it's it is really really really very very expensive , though .\nD : but we just have one button .\nA : so it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control has only one button .\nB : it's easy to use .\nA : easy , powerful .\nB : it's very easy to use .\nA : so don't think we need to redesign the the product .\nD : that's what we've just done .\nB : we've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so .\nA : so now so so did you enjoy your clay modelling ?\nB : so so what are we going to do with this project evaluation ?\nD : we have just have to discuss if .\nB : , it's fine .\nC : this is my job .\nA : was it way to create your remote control ?\nC : it's it's good , to to create control instead of computer .\nB : find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end .\nB : and designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and and it was very informative for .\nA : and for the marketing guy ?\nD : tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , .\nD : 'cause we just presenting one is presenting his next one his and then we try to combine afterwards , so it .\nA : and new ideas about new products , , wi which would be fashion and and yellow .\nB : you can think about yellow t_v_ now after fruit t_v_ or .\nB : it can be an interesting , just lemon t_v_ it'd be yellow lemon .\nA : yes , just lemon .\nC : but the traditional t_v_ it's it's flat , the shape is very boring .\nB : it's flat , , .\nC : could we come up with new t_v_ with such as this t_v_ ?\nB : it's really boring , .\nC : so you can you have base , triangle base so you the t_v_ you can .\nA : the lemon t_v_ with the pineapple remote control .\nB : that's that would be really interesting , actually .\nC : because the t_v_ you also .\nA : you could we could do fruit collection of electronics things .\nB : device devi the fruit ?\nD : but just don't trust too much the trends .\nD : 'cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years .\nA : la next year it will be insects .\nB : it's but it's good to follow the flow and make it now and after , , if the people change their mind you change also the product .\nD : two years it's dead .\nD : but this is good because it's not long long life product .\nD : t_v_ is more like fifteen years , , so .\nD : if you have lemon lemon t_v_ for fifteen years , .\nB : we can think about t_v_ with where you can change the aspects like for the cell phones , .\nB : you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and you can keep , you can keep the global appearan the mood of persons , the fashions we int , t_v_ , .\nA : you've already said mobile phones .\nD : tha that would that would make it .\nA : it's interesting , we can create line of t_v_ with tr so the costs are within the budget .\nB : t_v_ for autumn and t_v_ for winter , , so it's so what and do is it .\nA : we're just at twelve fifty euros .\nB : the pr at but it's really celebrating object .\nA : so do you think you can celebrate your creation ?\nC : and you can celebrate your leadership .\nA : mister david jordan .\nB : so it's yellow and very very ha it's very happy , so .\nD : it's party party remote control .\nB : it's it's pr it's like .\nA : the thing now is to to sell it .\nC : it's your job .\nB : , go and sell it .\nB : goo and good luck , so it should be fine .\nC : and the twelve fifty twelve twelve twenty five euros , .\nD : twenty five euros .\nD : it's it's cheap , .\nC : twenty five euros .\nA : it's little bit expensive .\nD : no , i'm not so happy about the fruit shape , .\nC : no , it's not so expensive .\nB : it should be it should be fine , , actually .\nB : like the the colour the colour are very good , so actually so it's perfect , and is the the yellow ball thing that like we can we can put some double , .\nA : what you can do test .\nA : put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit .\nA : but don't put sugar in it , it's not working .\nD : no , the colours are it's perfect , .\nD : another thing is the logo is missing still .\nA : but the colour , the colour is more is most important , because don't think you have ever seen something like that before for remote control .\nD : still that was one of the requirements we had .\nD : it's but it don't t's such problem just putting the logo somewhere .\nA : but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .\nA : so we can just integrate it on on one side , the double .\nB : that's actually good idea , so it's not mushroom .\nA : so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , so we have the slogan too .\nC : so we have to give so we have give him give it cute name .\nD : cute na you cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend .\nA : no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control .\nC : mush mushroom controller .\nA : it's pineapple now , it has changed .\nD : it's not the trend .\nB : it's pineapple remote controls .\nC : pa pine apple .\nB : pineapple remote remote control .\nD : but just flying saucer , or would say flying saucer .\nA : with cherry on top .\nB : that unid unidentified remote control , so that's that's pineapple remote control .\nD : it's more appropriate , somehow .\nA : will you buy one ?\nB : will try i'll try .\nC : twenty five euro .\nA : one thing like is the shape , because it's not like the the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on in your jacket .\nB : hel will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage always lose my , so so if it is universal one use it with my t_v_ , so it would be would choose this one because of the colour .\nC : you told me you you you you lost your control your t_v_ so so you need to buy one .\nC : so this one and this one .\nC : what do you choose ?\nA : prefer the laser remote control .\nC : what do you choose ?\nB : it's it's will enlight your house , your home and your t_v_ , so .\nA : next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside .\nB : that would be an idea .\nD : but that's going to be expensive , .\nD : we had some problems going to twelve euros and .\nA : it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and add some features to it after .\nD : afterwards , if if it's new trend .\nA : so champagne , mister baba .\nB : that's that fine .\nB : so we can celebrate now .\nB : that's our new product .\nD : we should celebrate .\nB : it's it's fine .\nB : it's like it .\nC : so buy one .\nB : i'll buy one here .\nA : so , will close this .\nA : so we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have nearly final product .\nD : our final prototype which .\nB : final prototype , , ye .\nA : final prototype , .\nA : so , very much .\nB : so who is going to take the remote control ?"], ["<t> The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting. </t>  <t> The rest introduce themselves, including Michael the interface designer, Guillermo the

everybody .\nA : everybody is not ready .\nA : so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes .\nA : so will be sebastian the project manager .\nA : you are the .\nB : i'm the user interface designer .\nD : hi i'm guillermo .\nD : i'm the marketing expert .\nC : and am hemant , the industrial designer .\nA : for being here .\nA : so let's have look to the the agenda .\nA : so , we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to to make to to be used to the tools available in this and smart meeting room we have here .\nA : then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it .\nA : so , the goal of this project is to developed new remote control .\nA : it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly .\nA : as usual we will follow the the project method that we are using in the in our company .\nA : it is in three step as .\nA : first the functional design .\nA : the second's conceptual design , and then the detailed design .\nA : during each step of each design we wi you will work separately , individually on your specific tasks and will we will meet to to discuss and take decisions about what you've you've you did and what we will do next .\nA : so first , we have to to train ourself with all the the tools availables in the in this meeting room and particularly the the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some some notes or do some drawings .\nA : so who want to start ?\nB : no one else wants to , .\nB : so , want me to draw my favourite animal .\nB : don't really have favourite animal , but have one in mind , so i'm gonna about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty the corner of white board .\nA : you have one in mind ?\nB : the spider has spider lives in web and it has eight legs , and it can move all about the web in two dimensions .\nB : unless it's three dimensional web which they have sometimes .\nB : there are some spiders that live in like that have like big ball of of web .\nB : and the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like parachute so they can actually go and find new build new web somewhere else .\nB : so they did this in in charlotte's web that movie that little t's actually book first but at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away .\nB : so , that's my animal .\nA : guillermo you want to ?\nD : why , but when was child wanted to be panther not pink panther , or yes .\nC : but don't you t's very difficult to draw panther ?\nC : so bad don't like it .\nA : it would be very funny for us .\nD : it's friendly panther .\nB : it's happy 'cause it just ate someone .\nD : actually , honestly what's what's his it's be behaviour , if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female , have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , so but like it because it's fast , and it's black as , so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like powerful , strong , .\nD : watch film about black panther when was child and was in that age when everything was shocking me lot .\nB : so you don't like pink panthers ?\nC : this lapel is coming out once in while .\nC : it's not very strong .\nC : so , not the favourite animal , but i'll draw elephant .\nC : i'll try to draw elephant .\nC : so , elephant goes like this , and then it has four feet .\nC : whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but this is the easiest .\nC : and then we have it's trunk .\nC : and something like this .\nC : an eye , cute .\nC : so and sometimes they have hump .\nC : it seems that elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way different way of walking .\nC : so when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be .\nC : when they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there .\nC : that's the way they walk .\nC : and that's very peculiar about them .\nC : none of the other animals walk like this .\nC : and they are very useful to human beings .\nC : at least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations , or when they had to carry huge loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful .\nC : and they are found in usually the warm countries .\nC : and they are the biggest terrestrial animal .\nC : that's what know about them .\nC : so , that's what wanted to tell about elephants .\nB : so is this an indian or an african elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ?\nC : there are two , they are very different , indian and african elephants .\nC : so indian elephant is having one bump , , and the african have two .\nC : and then there's difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are indian and so at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one do we have some message there ?\nA : we have to have to catch you , .\nC : some other time .\nA : we have to to go through the meeting .\nB : we can discuss that off-line .\nA : we'll discuss fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants .\nA : so so another important part of the project is about money , and about so about finances .\nA : so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control and we have which which would generate profit of of fifty million euros , .\nA : and we should target the inter an international market .\nB : so could ask one question , is this stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ?\nB : so it's gonna be you already have t_v_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it ?\nA : this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , so let's go to it .\nA : so we should decide which remote control we want to we want to we want to go .\nA : should be should should it be specific remote control to some specific device ?\nA : should it be universal one ?\nA : so so i'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go .\nB : so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to little strange if we what the the product is yet , but if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , we're gonna need to find out what's actually , what people ar are willing to pay for what product they're expecting for twenty-five euro because it seems quite lot for remote control , so it's .\nA : this is more job to our market person .\nA : so it should be the topic of of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and in which direction we should go .\nA : so we need to close the meeting .\nA : we'll have new meeting soon and so the work every every of you ha have to do .\nA : so you have to work on the on the working design , you have to work on the technical functions , and you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ?\nA : you will receive some information by emails , as usual .\nA : for coming today ."], ["<t> The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific. </t>  <t> He suggests they name the project and they come up with \"mando\", meaning \"control\" in Spanish. </t>  <t> The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes. </t>  <t> He suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD, which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation. </t>  <t> The industrial designer presents, showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing. </t>  <t> He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size, suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it. </t>  <t> They discuss voice recognition again, and then the interface specialist presents. </t>  <t> He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price. </t>  <t> They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the component concept. </t>  <t> The interface specialist will work on the user interface. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will work on trend-watching. </t>  <t> The remote control will be for television only. </t>  <t> The remote control should be fancy, a good shape, and not too small or too big. </t>  <t> To target towards young people will bring in new technology. </t>  <t> A wheel should be used to navigate. </t>  <t> Because of budget restrictions, they cannot do speech recognition technologies. </t>  <t> Corporate logo will be clearly displayed on product. </t>  <t> They have not yet decided whether to include an LCD screen. </t>  <t> Although the project manager clearly does not favor the idea because of budget costs and the possible requirement of internet connection, others are pushing for it. </t>  <t> They find that the budget is restricting their capabilities, and mentioned increasing the price of the remote control. </t> ", "A : everybody is ready ?\nA : good morning again .\nA : so , today we are going to have second meeting .\nA : michael , hi .\nA : you have good reason for that ?\nA : let's have look to the agenda today .\nA : so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design .\nA : so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting .\nA : so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics .\nA : goin i'm going to share with you .\nA : and we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on on on the working design .\nA : you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ?\nA : the u_i_ guy also work on that , , and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs .\nA : alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .\nA : but first would like quickly to to decide of to give name to the project .\nA : so , put quickly remo , but if you have any other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly .\nB : spanish name would work .\nD : was thinking of the mando .\nB : especially if we're selling into the u_s_ market becasue there's lot of spanish speakers there .\nB : something that sounds in english but sounds funny in spanish .\nB : what is that ?\nD : it doesn't it doesn't sound for me , but for spanish for for control .\nA : what does it mean ?\nB : what does it mean in spanish ?\nB : 'cause it also like in english it sounds like the man's tool because men like to have control of the remote so it might the mando .\nD : mando sounds latino .\nA : so , let's go for mando ?\nB : and we could have some like you you could have the fonts special , so you have man in like in in in one in one font and then the o_ as like although you don't wanna cut cut women out of the potential buyers though , do you ?\nA : so , this is .\nC : they are the most t_v_ watcher .\nC : so we should be careful .\nA : this is more question of of this is more question of of look and feel .\nD : but it because if the product will be international should start .\nA : something that should be addressed later .\nA : we should we should go to other for the other topics .\nB : that's the thing .\nB : we need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on .\nA : so let's stick to man mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later .\nA : so let's go for the three presentations now .\nA : so , who want to start ?\nA : so we could start with the market , .\nA : so have your slides somewhere ?\nD : should be in participant four .\nD : so will will give brief outline about what what prepared for this meeting .\nD : for the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements .\nD : prepare marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .\nD : and also di did study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years .\nD : there is no no significant difference between the the the first new controls and .\nA : sh next slide ?\nD : more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .\nD : so and they they admit that the the they should they would spend more money in fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point .\nD : also the people are worried about about the r_s_i_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not with not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old .\nD : so people are are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control .\nD : they are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so it would be good point to to to to find solution to any beep any alarm incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost .\nD : and also found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .\nD : so in my opinion the mando this mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost .\nD : liklier or more likely ?\nD : people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who which are not very use like memorising channels or or this actions which are not very often but they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the in the remote cont in the remote control .\nD : also the the design should fit the hand shape .\nD : so it may be interesting to to in both prototypes , for and left handed people .\nB : the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .\nB : so unless you're targeting single people you're gonna cut out some lot of your market .\nD : anyway it could be int interesting to to release some small fraction of of this remote controls .\nC : it could be universal design .\nC : universal design , which is which is good for both the hands .\nB : still shaped for for your hand but not for particular hand , ?\nC : whether it's left hand or hand , but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?\nC : the first and the third point , they are clashing .\nB : can still be , you can still extend past the hand .\nD : like , like no no was thinking of so like something .\nC : so fitting the hand doesn't mean much then .\nB : means like , this remote here is is very thin and long so instead of having you might have it bit bigger or , , with some some finger molds .\nC : so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?\nC : little sleek , longer ?\nC : and it should fit the hand .\nA : something with the shape of the palm ?\nB : some finger grips .\nB : you could even have some buttons like on the sides and everything , but .\nA : on the sides .\nD : it sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical .\nA : and then finally .\nD : and finally , the incorporation of or speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but if the budget would be large enough .\nA : first i'm just wondering about the because because , so it's good time for me to to bring you to some new new informations .\nD : but most of most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this technology .\nA : we had the new requirements from the so from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to they would like to be restricted to t_v_ .\nA : if you had this information already .\nA : no , so they want us to restrict the remote control to t_v_ only because of time limitations .\nA : they want also excellent .\nD : actually this marketing report is restricted to t_v_ remote controls .\nA : so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because ll te teletext is outdated now and finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .\nB : was still was still working on this twenty five euro price point because actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite low price if if we're get to this in my presentation though , but .\nA : so we can jump to your presentations , now .\nA : so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about and speech reco , what is your ?\nB : even even if it was within budget do speech reco rec system it might be bit difficult because if you you're watching t_v_ you're gonna have lot of this background noise from the t_v_ which might interfere with the participant three .\nB : you might have some background noise from the t_v_ which will make the speech recognition much harder , so .\nD : but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so .\nB : you press press button to talk , and the the t_v_ the t_v_ sound turns off .\nC : no it could be command control thing .\nC : it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .\nC : means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .\nC : because this thing means speech is there from the t_v_ also .\nC : so there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .\nC : it's like v_i_ editor , you are having two modes similarly .\nC : otherwise it's just lying idle .\nB : so , could describe the mouse be easier to could use the mouse , or .\nA : the wheel doesn't work .\nB : so while researching this this topic first of all just thought of couple of things that would like to see in remote , and just looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated remote controls on epinions dot com , which is customer written review site .\nB : so there's pretty wide range of remote controls these days and and this remote control on the here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means on it's own in being so expensive .\nB : there are lot of expensive remote controls out there .\nA : looks like p_d_a_ ?\nB : so it doe it's all the functions are controlled through through the screen except for the really really main functions , which have couple of of their own buttons .\nB : and if you look at lot of the universal remotes out on the market , know we're working on television remote , but lot of the universal remotes out there have have these screens which helps when you're using multiple devices suppose because you can have multiple functions different functions on the screen at different times .\nB : but the thing that find most interesting about this remote control , and it's difficult to to see in the slide , but it has scroll wheel on it , which is like mouse scroll wheel , which is it's really important design aspect is it's 'cause the thing is what what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do .\nB : and the the simplest thing that remote control does is it just change the change the channel .\nC : change the channels .\nB : now the that scroll wheel is actually pretty pretty handy way of of changing the channel .\nB : 'cause know when when use the remote to change the channel very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad .\nB : usually use the up and down because most channels are two digit numbers and you have to press special button to enter two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just it's annoying .\nB : so scroll wheel is is quite handy .\nB : now the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability .\nB : one possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because lot of this can't be done for twenty five eu euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the screen so that instead of actually saying want to want to go to channel thirty seven because know this programme's on , , often you what ch what channel it's on , or you what's on .\nB : if you have list of of programs on your screen you just scroll to that program rather than to channel .\nB : so if you think about it's like in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it .\nB : so this would be pretty handy thing to have , but we we really need to discuss the price .\nB : so , there are there are cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in different context .\nB : so this is something else we might wanna consider , is really limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating universal remote control on on epinions .\nB : it it's really worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible because really people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control .\nB : and was saying before about having different size buttons for different frequently used tasks , but also the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .\nB : so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .\nC : but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality .\nB : so we we will have bit of simpler task in that we're only doing television remote control .\nC : because the same button is doing too many things .\nB : one option is to have little flip-open door that that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons .\nB : would if had my perfect remote control , i'd probably just have no numbers on it because they're just in the way .\nB : they don't really do anything .\nB : although do also find flip-open doors bit of pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .\nB : but definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to minimum , but not not let that interfere with the functionality of of the device .\nB : that depends on how you market it .\nD : that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because if people see remo see the see remote control without numbers they will t's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional if i'm if you can sell speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will will buy it .\nC : it does sampling out of the .\nB : if you if you have the advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , , navigate to program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .\nA : can you continue , mi ?\nB : so , but .\nB : so , one of the really useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this programme driven interface rather than the channel number .\nB : so if we can have higher priced remote control that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing .\nB : there's the screen , which is too expensive , but also at the scroll wheel , haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .\nB : even that , , that would be fairly cheap thing , compared to an screen , to implement , but that would be quite useful as .\nB : and the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but one one option , since this is supposed to be fashionable device , is there's certain or factor that you can you can have with technology , and we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks .\nB : say you have like little another little base unit that can also receive signals as as the television where you can , say , change the lighting in the room .\nB : that would be something you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , , later on you could you can you also , selling the potential of the device .\nB : then you say potentially you can then do other like change the lights , , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and , that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .\nA : you want to go ?\nC : so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition , that means on my own , it should be .\nA : no , not that one .\nA : you are two .\nC : so the working design is user interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology .\nC : so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote .\nC : so the old users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as our marketing expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition thing .\nA : to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is new way of interacting that use wheel .\nC : so anyway , that didn't come into my mind , so that is possibility .\nC : these could be other interfaces .\nC : means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different interfaces .\nC : so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with .\nC : so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five euros money which we are thinking .\nC : otherwise we are just like others in the market .\nC : so anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually .\nC : so apart from the speech , we can have the scroll thing with the buttons .\nC : now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required .\nC : and for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .\nA : that increases the the cost also .\nC : but means we have to see how much what microphones and like that .\nA : do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target of such technologies is enough ?\nC : yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough .\nC : we we can target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc .\nA : wh imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into into the remote control .\nC : no it it could be little it could be .\nA : so it could be few centimetres .\nB : one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets , though , because , i'm not exactly where we're gonna sell this , but presume it's not gonna just be english speaking countries .\nB : so then you have to , you have to train models for .\nC : it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d_t_w_ could be which is the easiest .\nC : so you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having model which has to be trained and being micro-controller .\nA : we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this slide .\nC : so we can .\nA : this is this is this is very important issue in discussion .\nC : so , will you go to the next slide ?\nC : so this is the design which we are thinking so .\nC : we are having power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not .\nC : and then there are two things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time .\nC : so we could not put that .\nC : so now where the a_s_r_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different interfaces which could be there .\nC : so there is a_s_r_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format .\nC : and then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .\nC : so this is the easiest design the there could be .\nC : so an a_s_r_ decoder we can have things in .\nC : to have different technologies .\nC : so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a_s_r_ sitting there on the remote control .\nB : you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying turn volume up , and you press the press the button like people teach sign language to kids , by speaking and doing .\nC : but as soon as you try to put the microchip thing the price will go up .\nC : so these are the slight problems .\nA : so your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?\nC : because the reason is that if we go into the market means though don't have much idea , but as he the marketing expert presentation was so if we go with just the .\nB : actually i'm not so because i'm the if was using remote control to , say , turn the volume up because 't hear it very , don't really want to drown out what people are saying by talking when i'm when i'm instead of pressing up on on remote control .\nB : if there's some there's some dialogue all of sudden that 't hear , i'm trying to actually find out what's being said , so speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .\nA : so gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions now .\nD : but the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , like that .\nB : depends if it's remote control if the remote control is something that you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be useful feature of the speech recogntion .\nB : if you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be .\nA : so if if summarise everything we've de we we said .\nA : we are targeting t_v_ .\nA : we need we need to have remote control which is fanc fancy , which is which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .\nA : we have or good shape , yes .\nD : with good shape for the .\nA : we should bring new technologies for young peoples , and as we have also requirements to to use to to push thr toward the internet .\nA : this is something we can stick to it .\nA : and also , very interesting things i've seen on on on the one of the comp our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate .\nA : so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go to go to and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .\nA : first why not to go to .\nA : because as we are targeting t_v_ we can use t_v_ screen as screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have .\nB : depends though depends .\nB : if we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the t_v_ or we have control over the t_v_ then we can't actually display that .\nB : like if we if we produce the t_v_s then then we can put menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some something sitting in between the video signal and the and the t_v_ to superimpose those those menus .\nB : so that's an extra cost .\nA : don don't you ha don't we have contacts with people on t_v_ or or systems that exist that we can use ?\nB : this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote .\nB : are we still you say we're focusing on t_v_ , but is it still like universal remote in that it's replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?\nB : 'cause that really makes big difference .\nB : 'cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' t_v_s .\nB : it's just there are too many t_v_s out there .\nB : it's it's not really gonna for twenty five euro ?\nA : that's good point .\nA : what's what cou what could be the cost of , could we fit the the targets in terms of cost if we go to on the remote control ?\nC : it's not possible .\nB : but but , it would be good to there is any leverage in that any leeway in that that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro all we can really do is provide very basic remote control , and that seems to be against the philosophy of our company which is putting the fashion into electronics .\nB : so would would like to there's any chance of of increasing the of increasing the unit price .\nD : what would be wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an in remote control ?\nA : so you mean yo you mean we we should target something which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to in terms to had to have really an added value ?\nA : so regarding the automatic speech recognition , this is they have tele teletext .\nB : 'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .\nD : what what information ?\nD : but mo most of the t_v_s nowadays show the show the the but most of the t_v_s have teletext nowadays .\nA : because they have teletext on it .\nA : you have teletext sin signal that you can that you can that you can get thr through the channel .\nA : they have most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid one of our requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet .\nA : so to to to browse more easily the teletext .\nB : you can get lot more information on it .\nA : through through your remote control .\nD : so what would what would appear in the in the ?\nB : so you could have the name of the programme , you could have the start time where it's up to .\nA : the ti the start time , all the all the programmes you could have if this information is available from teletext , also .\nB : you could have even little image of the the the the main actors so you can quickly just even without reading no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there .\nC : are but just small thing , what market we are targeting ?\nB : they may not have pictures , but they do .\nB : there's dependi it also depends on the country .\nA : because for the same reason that we cannot informations on the t_v_ .\nA : we we couldn't grab information information which is not there .\nB : no but with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from .\nB : so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that .\nA : so so that mean we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the t_v_ , or or it should be special t_v_ connected to .\nB : if we're gonna we would definitely need the internet connection because even with don't think you could even get teletext information from the t_v_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the t_v_ .\nB : we need to find that out .\nA : we need to close the meeting .\nA : so very quickly .\nC : is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ?\nC : so the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy new remote or because the cost of thing could be as high as the t_v_ itself .\nC : that is very important .\nB : if it's really small t_v_ .\nA : people go to buy another remote control when they broke broke their , and they want to go for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have .\nA : so this is that we that that we should target .\nA : so the com the the the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology .\nA : the is still on disc is still open to discussion .\nA : it is up to you to go through this this way and to to report report me back next meeting .\nA : so , but not .\nD : that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the .\nC : it's it's cheaper as compared to the .\nA : it's cheaper , but we have no this is this is an open question for you .\nD : because with the you need more requirements .\nD : you need internet connection .\nD : you need more things .\nD : but for the speech recognition you you don't need anything .\nB : the thing is the type of peop the type of people that are gonna want to buy very stylish rem remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have wireless internet connection , or .\nD : you just say channel fifty , and that's it .\nD : but then we should move to another target because at twenty five dollars , it's to move to another target ?\nC : means twenty five euros is , .\nB : this is what we need to find out .\nB : can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?\nB : 'cause otherwise we need it's hard to guarantee that you're gonna ninety five percent is not good enough though .\nA : this is up to you to tell us .\nA : but i'm definitely not keen on to to no no no , i'm no i'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies .\nA : i'm not confident enough .\nA : i'm not that that we'll have product really that work .\nA : that work it's real .\nA : how to guarantee such performances is really hard .\nD : the expert said ninety five percent .\nA : this is still is is very bad .\nA : so , this is the end of this discussion .\nA : next meeting here are the task you have to work on .\nA : so you have to work on the component concept .\nA : you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through trend watching .\nA : so the question is still open about the thing .\nA : we hope that next meeting we will we'll take some decision that direction ."], ["<t> The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design. </t>  <t> He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. </t>  <t> Then they move on to the three presentations. </t>  <t> The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends. </t>  <t> They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons. </t>  <t> Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. </t>  <t> Next, the user interface specialist presents. </t>  <t> He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. </t>  <t> They have the option of using that technology. </t>  <t> He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have. </t>  <t> He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume. </t>  <t> He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have. </t>  <t> Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. </t>  <t> After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost. </t>  <t> The user could simply press a button on the base station and the remote control would start beeping. </t>  <t> Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control. </t>  <t> He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. </t>  <t> He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. </t>  <t> Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. </t>  <t> In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. </t>  <t> They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. </t>  <t> The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor. </t>  <t> They agree on having base station with the remote. </t>  <t> They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver. </t>  <t> After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on/off button for the TV. </t>  <t> Before the next meeting, the interface specialist and industrial designer have to work together on the user interface and the look/feel design. </t>  <t> The marketing expert has to look up product evaluation. </t>  <t> Thus far, LCD and ASR have been ruled out. </t>  <t> The remote will have a base station, a button on the base station to press, 2 scroll wheels for the channels and volume, a turbo button (possibly underneath the device), and an on/off button for the TV. </t>  <t> The group has not yet agreed on whether the remote should be banana-shaped. </t>  <t> There is concern that the shape is not handy and might make the product less marketable- that would be a problem since they have to meet the fifty million euros profit goal. </t> ", "A : hope you have good lunch .\nC : we had falafel .\nB : yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian .\nA : so today is our third meeting .\nA : it will be about the conceptual design .\nA : if come back to the minutes of the last meetings .\nA : we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs .\nA : so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today .\nA : at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .\nA : so hope that your respective pr presentations will help us .\nA : so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform who starts ?\nA : so you are you saved your your presentation somewhere ?\nA : so you're four ?\nA : which is trend watch .\nA : mr marketing experts .\nD : investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users .\nD : so the the current investigation the current the current trends ?\nD : wha what found can you .\nD : what found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device .\nD : after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was the functional look and feel .\nD : so now more more aspect , ma more cooler aspect rather than device with many functions and many buttons with instead of instead of ha of device which can do many things , device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .\nD : also in euro in in paris and and milan the in paris and in paris and milan the the current trend of of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .\nD : and also in the in the u_s_a_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's spongy .\nD : spongy means eponge ?\nD : so we should we should in this direction , so fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in milan ?\nB : what what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ?\nB : what you mean clothe no , missed that one .\nC : spongy means it it's like sp but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ?\nD : didn't miss an didn't miss and saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .\nB : they're so they're not like dressed as carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , .\nD : no no , not not yet , not yet .\nB : so we're not gonna have remote control in the shape of of banana , just and so which fruit are you thinking of ?\nD : so te textu textures , .\nD : vegetable textures and all this kind .\nA : drawings of bananas .\nA : so this is in the next slide certainly .\nD : no no , it's not .\nD : ha haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some vegetable , some instead of vegetable , some natur natural object .\nD : but it it depends on the the shape the shape no , not not not too much focus , not too much focu not not too not too similar to fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different .\nA : so you you can display banana on the .\nB : so you want the remote control to be the shape of fruit , or you want just some like fruit logo on the so something that looks half like fruit and half like an elephant .\nC : means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits , apple , banana , something like that .\nA : apple for channel one .\nD : so we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend but , .\nD : african or as an elephant ?\nC : that we can discuss afterwards .\nB : but , i'm not , i'm not really if that would really appeal to everyone though , just to fashion gurus , like just like little bit little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but about how ergonomic , an orange is .\nD : ma we we should further specify what target are we focusing .\nD : in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also according to the marketing report ninety ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy cooler remote control .\nB : but is it is fruit ?\nD : is the new trend of the no we we should think about shape with it device with shape of some .\nB : , apple has the ipod so , imag 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is .\nB : but it has to be easy to to use though and to hold , you don't wanna pear or watermelon .\nD : don don't you think we can find the shape of fruit which is handy to use ?\nB : probably the only thing is banana that think of , cucumber .\nB : so , but you also have to you have to also have , fit all the buttons and .\nB : it's , it the thing is you have normally with with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on cylindrical device it may be difficult to to build .\nC : don't it will be rolling lot .\nD : but li like your idea that we shouldn't have lot of buttons buttons so do you want an with twenty five euros ?\nA : and you you you will not have pla enough lot of place to put on banana also .\nA : you're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not .\nD : according to the to the report people are more interested in in fa fancy look and feel and in technological inno in innovation , so , will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it's i'm not convinced about this because you need internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying more things .\nA : so so you you you suggest to go .\nA : so you're simply you're simply looking to remote control that looks like banana with few buttons with only few buttons .\nD : it's not so simple .\nD : for for for given an an example .\nA : so you can go ahead ?\nD : no , it's what already said .\nA : i'll give the floor .\nA : so you are user interface guy .\nA : so you're three ?\nA : and it's this one .\nA : go for it .\nB : so received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , which is way for you to have conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control .\nC : but it's just speaker ?\nB : it's no , what it is , it's it's very it has has microphone , has speaker , it's got little chip and it allows you , it's sample sensor sample speaker .\nC : it's not microphone .\nC : actually i'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you .\nB : sample sensor sample speaker .\nB : it means that it can recognize , it can do like match on on certain phrase that you speak and then can play back phrase in response to that .\nB : but there's no understanding of the phrase .\nB : so , , , you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .\nB : but the thing is , we have this technology available in-house .\nB : so , but the thing is there's still gonna be cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production of the components , so it it but it means we we can consider this from theoretical or usability viewpoint without worrying too much about how to develop it because we have this already done .\nB : whilst , some people might get annoyed if we if we just dump it , it's it it's no , , it's it'll recognize keywords , but keywords in certain order like phrase .\nA : there's something that unclear really understanding .\nA : is this technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ?\nB : you train it for certain , for certain phrase , you say the the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ?\nA : and it's just to , it's just to playback something ?\nB : so actually that was bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so .\nA : so this is not really to do to to do control .\nB : only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize set set target word an it's designed it's designed as fun thing , but you could use it as as way to implement completely pointless .\nA : this is just more like poi pois .\nA : so it it's it it it is easy fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of point of view .\nD : but you can but the can we use it for saying , channel fifty , channel twenty ?\nB : unless , you like having conversation with your remote control .\nB : that's the thing , if you can but you have to pro though it's fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to tr train it to to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that logic in it .\nA : so this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it .\nB : so , that would be some development work .\nA : so this is out of discussion .\nA : so if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control no this is banana-bando , .\nB : banana-man don't t's worth it though , it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as speech recognition engine , so , .\nA : then it could be .\nC : let's go ahead .\nB : so if we can just move on to the next slide , i've just done quick mock-up of some of the features of our potential funky-looking remote control , you see , was was unaware at this point of of the fruit focus , , so at the moment it's more of box focus .\nA : it doesn't look like banana .\nA : but you you can fit you're saying now you can fit it to .\nD : looks like tr look likes tro tropical fruit .\nB : , this is actu this could be genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be square so that it packs tighter in the boxes .\nB : but , i've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause the scroll wheel is fairly key part of , , everyone has has that it's that it could be quite useful thing , so .\nC : stable thing , .\nC : to have , , .\nB : but it's important , , to have two scroll wheels because , , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it's it's the volume it's , it's very handy for it to have instant feedback and response , so .\nB : but , i've also included this turbo button because , , every design should have turbo button , and so this is , unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the the tuner on the t_v_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so , the the person might want to have might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , , displays that station .\nD : what's turbo button ?\nB : or they might want to scroll and and have quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing .\nD : it con it controls the speed ?\nB : so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over channels if , , if i'm if i'm going if i'm scrolling past them and , it's , you could have little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel it's really going fast or whatever .\nB : so , that's , those are the two important features we need on the remote , but we can discuss about what other buttons we need , .\nB : it could be , , if we if we wanna have like very cheap device , , we could either consider that we want to sell this as very , if it's gonna be banana , that's pretty gimmicky thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just couple of scroll wheels and button it's hard to get so many buttons on banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , , what other buttons do we want ?\nB : we could have , you need an on and off switch , but you could you could you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana , , it's like spy flick thing .\nD : so sounds crazy .\nD : like crazy ideas .\nB : that's why you're marketing guru .\nA : so it looks like we're going completely to forget about the thing .\nB : that's the thing , as have we decided that we can only spend , , twenty five euro ?\nA : that no we can we can't use that .\nB : not spend , but , charge twenty five euro .\nD : we could use somehow the coffee machine dialogue interface or so .\nD : you we can ?\nA : we can't use that to to comman co communicate , it's just thing no .\nD : but we can say channel twenty five .\nC : it's one way .\nB : but then you have to have template for every channel , for hundred channels , you have to be able to to recognize .\nD : it's not lot one hundred templates , it's not , it's designed for cof .\nB : it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for coffee machine , , to say hello in the morning .\nD : is it design for coffee machine ?\nB : that's its current application , would presume that it's , they wouldn't design it to handle hundred things so .\nD : you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can .\nA : good good good thing .\nB : but just made the point , don't if that speech recognition is , , even if we can do it , it's not really appropriate for television environment .\nA : you want to to move to your slides ?\nB : but did have one thing from previous meeting , you were talking about being able to find the remote control and was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having , base station that can control other things as .\nB : it might be useful to have some base station , even if it's just you press on button on it and and the remote control starts beeping , , this is way of finding the remote .\nB : in that case the the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say i'm here but it's probably bit of overkill if you could just have beeping it's speech it's it's speech synthesis and it's speech , not really speech recognition , but pattern matching , .\nC : so it's speech synthesis thing , something has been stored and it's just spoken out .\nA : let's move on .\nA : so you're two ?\nC : so this is going to be about the component design .\nC : so first thing is we need power source for the remote control .\nC : so was of the idea that we can have two power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's basis station thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty innovative kind .\nC : then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in .\nB : that fits in with the spongy design philosophy .\nC : so there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve .\nC : the science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve .\nC : then controls for the traditionals traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them .\nB : so , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ?\nB : you reckon you could like draw us thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause i'm not , but like , convex or concave ?\nC : double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if i'm .\nC : so it's symmetrical thing , whatever it is .\nC : so , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want .\nC : so there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves .\nC : these are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve .\nC : so there there was there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's wooden cases .\nB : although , , wood could be quite stylish option , if you take like , quality wood that's got grain and you put some , some varnish on .\nA : but but there is no elasticity which could be but the components inside .\nB : depends , , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , it's the inside .\nB : but inside you could have you can still have some cushioning that's not visible to the to the user .\nA : very too expensive to do .\nB : and you could also , you can have just very thin veneer of wood as .\nA : and also but it's more easier to do banana in plastic than in wood .\nB : that's true , but are we set on the banana idea ?\nD : actually was thinking that the the shape of banana is not it's not really handy .\nA : look like it looks like you are all targeting that ?\nA : yes it is .\nD : the name in english this it's not fruit it's vegetable .\nC : is it an apple which has banana is more handier as compared to this , and to capsicum .\nB : it's like pumpkin or green .\nB : what does it taste like ?\nD : and you put in the salad .\nD : oui c'est ca pepper .\nB : is it what's it in french ?\nB : , so capsicum or pepper .\nA : but they do .\nD : and it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of no , in i'm it's fun .\nB : it seems little bit bulky to me , like like with banana you can have but like banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel on top and just roll it back and forth like that , but with how you would hold capsicum and so is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ?\nA : it's not re it you you t's really fancy and fun ?\nA : you think that young people that are .\nA : more than banana ?\nD : but banana is not so handy , that's handier .\nA : it's kind it's it's more it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've lot of surface to to put the controls .\nA : let's move on .\nA : so time is running , let's move on .\nC : so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing .\nC : these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that .\nC : we can go to the next slide .\nC : then there are different chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip .\nC : so we can have regular chip for control .\nC : pricing is factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip .\nC : and regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .\nC : it could be beep thing .\nC : yes , yes , , it's it's onto the chip , most most probably , not not hundred per cent about that .\nB : so are there any issues where we place this this chip to make you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?\nC : that will be the volume control which which user shou it it should be already pre-defined .\nC : it should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside .\nB : but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker .\nC : so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .\nC : as or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , so that .\nB : so that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside .\nC : so these these were the component selection and these things .\nC : we can go to the next slide .\nC : and these were the findings which saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our t_v_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v_c_r_ d_v_d_ players which are usually attached with the t_v_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .\nB : although , if it depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like fruit design , then we wanna sell collection of fruit , , like different fruit for each device .\nB : that , , that sometimes people like to collect things that of similar type .\nC : remotes objects , .\nD : that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits .\nB : you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place .\nD : no but just one fruit to control everything .\nB : like power fruit .\nD : power fr power mando , supermando fruit .\nC : and as as could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really hot thing and we should have it on the remote .\nD : actually didn't understand very this trace speaker lost control .\nB : that's pretty handy feature .\nC : so you're having basis station .\nC : your usually your remote sits on that .\nC : so you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries .\nC : now let's say basis station is with the thing .\nD : so you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station .\nA : bu it's it's .\nA : you you you thing .\nC : it's like telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there .\nC : so now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost .\nC : so you're having the basis station and there is button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so where the remote is .\nB : it's people would find that worth it even if it wasn't recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , .\nD : but i'm bit worried about the budget .\nB : so although you do need to include r_f_ circuitry in the remote .\nC : this is basis station is nothing more , just it's wire which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket on which the thing sits .\nC : but all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems .\nC : so component cost is going to be the least .\nC : anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , has already been ruled out , a_s_r_ has been ruled out .\nC : so it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly .\nB : i'm just wondering actually , 'cause , , this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's it seemed like it first seems bit niche , like only few people would really want banana , but what if it was stylised banana ?\nB : rather than having it yellow and really looking exactly like banana , you could make it silver .\nB : and , to give you the idea of banana but without it looking completely kitsch .\nB : for better want of better word ?\nA : you think that yellow it's kitsch .\nB : , don how many peop they , like this colour this colour , , like still in the shape of banana .\nA : if you make something that looks like banana it should have the colour of banana .\nD : no , li like that .\nC : otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get any feeling then .\nC : it's neither banana nor and going to the last slide .\nB : no , exactly .\nB : but , just not exactly the same texture as banana and just , because the thing is it's gonna be little bit difficult to make to give like the texture of banana anyway and to to have the exact shape .\nB : if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as do it in stylised way that just looks bit more , , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies .\nA : let's move on .\nA : before before st before ending the meeting i'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .\nA : go for it .\nA : no , not not you , you can finish your slides before .\nC : anyway , users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes .\nC : so that was very it's very good suggestion by everybody .\nA : so so done for the presentations .\nA : so we need to take some de decisions about about what we're going to do .\nA : so propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and where superman go banana and extra func functionalities such as wheels , the speaker unit not in order not to lost the the device , do don't remember you call it ?\nC : the basis station .\nA : basis station , .\nA : so so we're going for stylish banana shape .\nB : so , you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna hold as ma you wanna kinda hold like gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point towards the floor .\nB : so , so if you have like , so so , so we need , , something that can fit banana shaped object .\nD : what about what about this shape ?\nD : more or less .\nA : we if it if it has really the model shape of bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of banana if you want to point really at the thing .\nC : there's less space on this to put with the buttons .\nD : but how many buttons do we need ?\nA : if you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it , it's better .\nC : what about the base station .\nA : so ti time is running , we have to we have to we have to to move forward .\nA : so let's skip to this this this this idea .\nA : so we have this .\nA : we have basis , how do you call it ?\nA : we'll have base station extra on the side .\nA : we have r_f_ for for beeping for beeping .\nC : , we need that , .\nA : we need r_f_ to beep .\nA : so we that means we need button on on the on the basis .\nA : basis station , .\nB : alright , so we need .\nA : can you go quickly ?\nA : so we are going to add also you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo button .\nB : which it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , so you have yes .\nA : on the , here .\nA : and the and the wheel at the level of the thumb .\nB : so you have the thumb here .\nA : and and you have two wheels .\nB : so , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel .\nB : and , no .\nB : we need we need power on off switch as .\nC : for the remote ?\nA : just the switch , no not for the t_v_ for the t_v_ .\nC : remotes don't have power on off switch .\nA : so you on the side .\nC : no , that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already , .\nD : what what about four millions ?\nC : means on the remote .\nC : because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as as buttons .\nC : they are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this .\nB : if the traditional user is gonna buy banana remote in the first place , .\nC : that's that's another issue which didn't think of .\nB : you need to keep it , how many of these did we wanna sell ?\nC : but our targets are very high , means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make .\nB : 't remember , what was , but how many units did we need to to sell ?\nC : twelve point five is the profit on one .\nC : point point four million ?\nB : four point four million .\nC : point four million .\nB : that's lot of fruit .\nC : in the market .\nD : what about what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ?\nA : time is running , we have to close the meeting in few minutes .\nA : so , , the next step , you can come back to your seat .\nA : the next step is to go for to is to go to to building prototype , based on this , ?\nA : so next meeting you have to prepare the followi things .\nA : you have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface , you two you have to work together to model the first first prototype .\nA : marketing expert have to go to product evaluation .\nA : it's too difficult .\nD : it's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really innovative and if it would cost lot , just few five words .\nA : it's not possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so it's in the next prototype so let's skip it .\nC : for the future prototypes .\nA : , for the if if if it it works , we'll go for an orange one .\nB : that can be the that can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando .\nA : honour the fruit .\nD : plus plus , .\nA : we'll see next meeting .\nC : so meeting's over ?\nB : we have to go design the prototype ."], ["<t> The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. </t>  <t> They have the prototype presentation and talk about the

: so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control .\nA : so here is the agenda for today .\nA : just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting .\nA : and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts .\nA : then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro .\nA : so let's go .\nA : if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting .\nA : so we went through we took this following decisions .\nA : no , no speech recognition technology , , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control .\nA : we went through the use of wheels and but buttons .\nA : and also the use of basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost .\nA : so let this wonderful thing .\nC : so we can go to the slides .\nA : which is can you show it to the the camera .\nC : so final design .\nC : so michael you can go ahead .\nB : so following our decision to make yellow to make banana remote so we actually have we've first first of all we made an attractive base station with banana leaf look and feel and bana sit the banana sits in there nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and this is the remote itself , it's it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand rather .\nC : you can pull it out first , .\nB : we've got the two scroll wheels here which one on the the left for the volume and the one on the for for the channel and underneath we have the the turbo button which is in like trigger position for for pressing quite naturally .\nA : what's the use of the turbo button already ?\nB : this is when you when you are scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to to skip past channels that you quickly rather .\nA : an then you stop when you stop it stops .\nB : when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops .\nB : but normally with it will just stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .\nC : and we we do have one more functionality .\nC : if you take the banana as such and you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the t_v_ .\nB : the the turbo button .\nC : the turbo button .\nB : so rather than having an extra button for for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .\nD : what this button for ?\nB : this is teletext button .\nB : so once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as to navigate .\nA : to navigate it through through teletext .\nD : but if you want to go to page seven hundred ?\nA : with the wheel it's easy .\nD : how man don't understand it .\nB : then you can you you have like little number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button to move between the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can and this is the the infrared port .\nD : can you repeat it ?\nC : so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing .\nC : and you can tele , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .\nB : also the top of the banana .\nB : and then we have in the in the base station we have the the button at the front for for calling the the banana .\nA : and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?\nB : actually they do .\nB : that's that's that's that's form and function in the one in the one object .\nC : so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having better coverage .\nC : it's like antennas .\nB : but that's that's just like that's an attractive base station .\nA : so , what else ?\nC : and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and the basis station is going to have the input from the power line for for charging the batteries .\nD : is it really weight ?\nD : is it light or .\nC : it is very light .\nB : it's it's it's about the weight of banana .\nB : to give you the correct look and feel .\nC : and we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as banana .\nC : otherwise it's child comes and so .\nB : child would try to eat it anyway , so we should consider that .\nB : health and safety aspects .\nC : we didn't think of that yet .\nA : so for the power source , you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries .\nA : so , where are going to where are you are you going to place them ?\nB : don't really the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have recharging base station .\nC : it'll it'll be always at top somewhere at there .\nB : if was gonna place them i'd put them on the on the top here since that's like the black bit but don't really don't t's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .\nA : you have enough surface ?\nC : because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is .\nA : what will be the autonomy ?\nB : what do you mean ?\nA : how long does how how how long can it be held off station ?\nD : how long the how long the bit the batteries long .\nC : eight to ten eight to ten hours .\nA : long , so it's it's used only when you .\nB : no no no , it can it should be weeks .\nC : most no most of the time it's not being used .\nB : but people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so , .\nC : so when when you are making it on .\nC : no eight or eight or ten hours of working .\nC : if you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer .\nC : and we are having the speakers regular chip for control .\nC : pricing is was factor so that's why we have gone for regular chip only not the advanced chip .\nC : and that's it .\nA : those really sounds very good .\nA : nothing else to add ?\nB : it seems to be falling over .\nD : like like it .\nD : the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons .\nD : looks bit looks bit puzzled how to say that .\nC : you want to have more functional buttons ?\nD : you the the the buttons change their function depending if it's teletext or not and the volume button will will become and what about people who want to use digits ?\nC : you are not convinced .\nC : not not many , we we want to keep it simple .\nC : so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .\nC : it's up to you , means .\nC : now that means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .\nA : fact both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext .\nB : or can move between positions in the in the number .\nD : butto real buttons ?\nC : so there was there was constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .\nC : so we are targeting segment which is which is just very trendy thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more .\nC : and anyway evalua .\nD : because have you thought about configuration and all this ?\nB : it's all automatic .\nD : it's all automatic .\nA : very good you .\nD : we are living in wonderful world .\nA : so so we have to go through now evaluations .\nA : so your slides are ready ?\nA : so this is one , which one is this one ?\nD : const constructed list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements .\nD : and each criteria is will be evaluated it's logical criteria so we must users must say if it's true or is or if it's false in in scale ranging from zero to seven .\nC : why this strange factor of seven ?\nC : usually have seen that scales are from one to ten .\nD : it's from , it's from one to seven .\nD : it's from from one to seven .\nD : because it should be an even it should be an even scale , and five is too short and nine is too long .\nA : num number so to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation .\nC : fine , got the idea .\nD : the variance is mi it's is minimal .\nD : i'm answering your question .\nD : and that's the criteria found more useful .\nD : sh could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?\nD : and we all four could range could evaluate the let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or seven but would say seven .\nC : so you can say fancy , handy .\nC : it's fancy , according to me .\nC : seven by me .\nD : it's quite fancy .\nC : so you can add seven plus six plus seven plus five .\nA : what do you say seven ?\nB : five , six it's it's it's .\nA : six point five .\nC : again i'll give seven .\nB : i'd give it six like i'd it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but loses the point for not having the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you can always use your other remote .\nA : so seven , seven , six , six point five .\nC : seven for me .\nC : i'll give five .\nD : would say everything ar everything it's compared to the all remote controls .\nB : depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or does what it does , , can it make you coffee ?\nA : for remote control , does he have all the you could expect .\nC : what is available in the market off the shelf .\nB : have to say four .\nD : actually what are the the real specification of of universal remote contro it's not an univer but it's for all t_v_s ?\nB : t's not universal remote .\nB : remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on t_v_s .\nB : all t_v_s but only t_ only t_v_s .\nA : so it's universal but for t_v_s .\nC : so four point two ?\nB : there are some outliers so which i'll say five .\nC : there i'll give it seven .\nD : it means features , like new features actually .\nC : for t_v_ the most important feature which felt was the locator which is feature .\nC : and then the scroll buttons are again features .\nC : we don't have for it but that we decided we don't want to have .\nD : would say five .\nA : plus six , say said seven .\nA : so it's six .\nD : you said seven ?\nB : 'cause it's five five seven seven so , , definitely easy to use .\nA : outl you are not lik outlier .\nD : have them of cour the most difficult question for the end .\nB : alright , now here's the sixty million dollar question , , twenty five twenty five euro question .\nA : i'll buy the banana .\nB : what do you what do you reckon ?\nC : i'll say five .\nA : twenty five euros .\nC : i'll say five .\nD : find it quite cheap actually .\nD : if it depends , if you live in in switzerland or you live in .\nA : so the target price is for all europe , or only for rich countries ?\nA : it's more targeting u_k_ or so this is selling costs , not production costs .\nD : wha the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or this is the the initial specifications .\nD : would say six .\nD : it's quite cheap actually .\nB : i'd say two .\nB : don't want banana on my living room table , banana remote .\nA : aw , should be in your it's kitsch .\nC : no but it's really handy actually if you see .\nB : it is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible .\nC : it's it's so handy .\nC : and then anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .\nB : but it's not positive thing .\nC : it's very positive thing if you see like that .\nB : , it's it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's banana .\nA : don't forget , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are who are wh , youngst youngst no if you would be young .\nD : actually change the question .\nB : but it says , would buy this , so .\nA : not telling that you are young .\nA : li li like teenager .\nB : no , it's .\nA : you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things .\nB : would buy still i'd say two .\nC : you want to flaunt .\nC : you with your girlfriend .\nA : you want to show the beautiful banana you have .\nC : or might be it does some other thing but , crazy .\nB : don't at any stage in my life would want banana remote control , really .\nA : so you you give know .\nB : say , there is market for it , .\nA : so you say two .\nA : so what's the new question ?\nC : and you have saved it ?\nD : so upload the it's two different situations .\nC : you'll have to reload .\nB : so , it depends if if had if had to spend twenty five euro , if that was like my limit , would buy it .\nD : if you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for for new one .\nA : that's two different question .\nB : because the other twenty five euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than banana .\nC : they're not going to be as and they they might not be as easy as this .\nB : and it this is gonna handy to use .\nC : go slightly up .\nA : stick to five .\nB : although it still has it still has the word at the beginning so .\nA : we have six , five three so we are six , five , four .\nB : i'd give it i'd give it give it four now .\nC : six , five , four .\nD : six , so it's five point five , or less .\nA : so so and last question , will change my rem change my remote control from mando banana .\nA : no we can't .\nD : actually , we five ?\nA : no let's say i'll put two .\nB : i'd say three , my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible .\nB : if it was change my remote control of my d_v_d_ player for mando banana then would be more inclined to but 'cause it's really bad but i'd say three .\nA : it's for the t_v_ .\nC : i'll still give it five .\nA : two three five two three fi and two .\nD : you are romantic , really .\nD : would say two .\nC : so it's somewhere three point five .\nA : so it's , three point five .\nD : who is the outlier ?\nD : wh wh you said five ?\nC : no said five .\nA : no no you say five , he is the outlier .\nA : just just do sum .\nD : if it's no because there are more , we shouldn't sum like that .\nB : it's not very promising but we're not young trendsetters .\nA : we should we should have look globally glob .\nD : because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually .\nD : otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell .\nB : is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ?\nD : no didn't anything .\nB : just leave it at that then .\nA : so we can we should stick to general feeling .\nA : we can had have out of these numbers , which which is that should go for it .\nD : do you want me to sum it's not actually what's the differen too expensive .\nA : problem with connectors ?\nB : it it you just lose information if you sum it , so .\nC : it's it's funny .\nA : so let's move let's move on .\nA : now now we have to to estimate the cost .\nA : so prepare an excel sh an excel sheet .\nA : are going to calculate the production costs .\nA : we should we should be below twelve point five .\nA : so already put some pu some numbers here , .\nA : we are going to go through so this is the number the number of components we need for this thing .\nA : so it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about .\nA : and also things that forget to to put like solar cells .\nB : decided against the solar cells so you mean , charging it by shaking the banana .\nA : finally we say no .\nC : solar cells , , we said no to that .\nA : so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines .\nA : so hand dynamo .\nA : this something we didn't thought about .\nC : rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .\nC : to bring the cost .\nA : so we we stick to battery , one .\nA : no kinetic also .\nA : don't don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo .\nB : dynamo is like you have to actually .\nA : you have to see so kinetic is really shaking the banana .\nA : so those banana is falling .\nA : let's go ahead .\nA : so we we st only have one for battery .\nA : then for electronics so didn't put anything for the .\nC : so we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .\nC : and that's it .\nA : no so we hin so one .\nC : and we have sample speaker .\nC : the cost of that is very high .\nA : ye ye ye the cost is increasing .\nB : actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that , we're just using the the very beep simple beep , that that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything .\nA : so we are the beep .\nA : that's what so i'll remove it .\nA : so don't we need there is no listing for radio frequency thing .\nC : and we have sev .\nC : so we we'll put some extras , if there is something .\nA : we'll see later .\nA : so in for the case put single curved .\nC : to reduce the cost , it's .\nB : second , no , it's it's double curved , it's got , it's it's monotonic but it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved , one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides .\nA : because we have two things .\nC : it's got all the directions so don't worry .\nC : it's got direction .\nA : what what if put one here .\nB : this is actually this probably this probably actually costs more than three if you .\nA : so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all .\nA : so we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .\nB : no didn't we say we wanted to do rubber if you drop it ?\nA : no , it's too no .\nA : it's too expensive .\nA : we're already at eleven .\nB : we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in .\nA : so put rubber one .\nA : so special colour , yellow .\nA : for the interface we have we have three .\nC : we don't have any push buttons .\nB : no , we have two push buttons .\nC : no that is scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that .\nA : we have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .\nD : actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here .\nB : it's gonna have to be plastic .\nA : and no it's no chip .\nA : this is just radio frequency .\nA : this is no chip .\nD : but you need fo it does nothing actually ?\nC : there's no chip there .\nC : it just emits the signal .\nC : and the receiver accepts it and that's it .\nC : just se sends the signal , that's it .\nB : it's recharger thing and actually did think about it myself but because you could potentially you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for instead of turbo button but the turbo button does add that extra class .\nA : we didn't think thought about integrated scroll wheel push buttons .\nB : so if we're if we're over budget then we could we could rethink that .\nA : so no , so for we have no button supplements , ?\nA : fact could we could not we consider this button as button supplement because no , these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials .\nB : no we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons .\nA : so so we are over budget .\nC : so first thing which we should take care of is , instead of rubber , let it be plastic .\nB : make it plastic instead of rubber .\nB : and then we're on budget except for ten cents .\nC : and that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there .\nA : so mayb we have to put two here because it cost nothing .\nB : pl the base station is made out of many units of plastic .\nC : so might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go .\nA : exactly exactly so we have margin for that .\nB : does that include charging circuitry and everything ?\nB : so what do we do with the extra profits ?\nA : we'll invest in and d_ .\nB : the next fruit .\nA : so 're under the the the cost .\nA : so we can go to through to project evaluation .\nD : so now we have product which nobody would would buy .\nD : would , would buy .\nB : no we have product which none of us would buy .\nD : because the evaluation project would buy , .\nA : which is different .\nA : which is different .\nA : none of us will buy it .\nB : no it's people in in in milan and in paris that are gonna buy it .\nB : we're not in milan or paris .\nD : you have been in milan couple of times , so .\nB : actually there were lot of that's 'cause i'm sick of milan .\nA : this is battery .\nD : and you said the lowest .\nA : this is what we which you can it did .\nD : for the batteries .\nA : extra battery , .\nA : exac fact did not didn't know really what to say here .\nB : so project process .\nA : if if you have any ideas of what we can we can say .\nA : so don't don't don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction and for and .\nA : should it be more like like status of of the these meetings .\nA : fact we we use little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .\nB : we had fair bit of creativity .\nA : it's really creative .\nB : and but one thing we missed out of this whole process was like focus group with the actual people we're targeting .\nB : we needed some of these young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and see if they see if they like it .\nC : they like that .\nA : we should go through , an evaluation .\nB : because the evaluation for us is is pointless .\nA : so you should we should do kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples , do you like to have banana as remote control .\nB : because it it would also be interesting to you to know find out if we have market in really young children as , to see how to how to market this thing .\nB : 'cause if you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but in some households where there is t_v_ for each kid , then , banana remote control could be fun for them as .\nB : might have to draw face on it .\nB : so but that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .\nA : any any new ideas we could we could investigate next time ?\nA : dunno , oranges ?\nC : the cost of the thing can be made more than might be .\nC : because it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to .\nB : there are ways we could simplify the just the the the circuit board that we're using inside , i'm not really how complicated our our needs are .\nB : all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to to process that .\nD : so more general remote control instead of just focusing on on t_v_ .\nD : the complexity shouldn't be much higher .\nD : for you said if it good for d_v_d_ then would bye .\nB : and also fo for mood lighting and and , that would be rather .\nB : that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to to control things other than the t_v_ and not just electronic equipment but the whole environment of the room .\nC : so what else ?\nA : we we can go home .\nA : we can hassle the the production department to to make real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate .\nA : so very much ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves by name and their role in the

to start new project which is about designing remote control .\nA : so i'm going to be the project manager of this project .\nA : and so i'm present myself .\nA : i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself .\nA : so , you can starts .\nB : so my name is petre .\nB : you can call me petre , or peter if you like .\nD : my name's bob mor .\nA : and you are ?\nA : in the project ?\nB : in the project i'm supposed to be the technic .\nD : so my name's bob morris .\nD : i'm the marketing expert for this project .\nC : my name is hamed getabdar , and i'm going to be interface designer in this project .\nA : so , , so today we are doing short meeting to present the project , so we are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project .\nA : we are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , .\nA : so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting .\nA : so what is the goal of this project ?\nA : is to design new remote control .\nA : so it should be , , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly .\nA : that mean it's very challenging project , and .\nA : so it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy .\nA : so , so what's what are we going to do during this all this project ?\nA : so it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in in our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find good way .\nA : and everything is will be like this .\nA : so now we are going to to get used to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project .\nA : so we can try to use the whiteboard here .\nA : we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the our favourite characteristics about it .\nA : so so will ask you all to do the same .\nA : just to get used to the whiteboard .\nB : so probably would try to try to draw the animal .\nB : sh should draw the picture of the animal ?\nA : , you can draw the picture , .\nB : would use the bird .\nB : so tried to sketch it out .\nB : had to first write it down because am not if draw it , but .\nB : can you recognise it as bird ?\nB : it's your turn to it's .\nD : so my favourite animal would be cat .\nD : that's its head .\nD : probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and playful .\nC : if should go with this .\nC : if it is enough line .\nD : put it up put it put it on the desk .\nB : should get used to the tool , so .\nB : just little bit .\nB : could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ?\nC : they should be remote .\nB : it it works like this .\nD : your lapel microphone's fallen off .\nB : are you left-handed ?\nC : like horses because they are strong and beautiful , so if want to write it here , .\nB : it's better if you leave it .\nD : we should just continue .\nD : don't worry about it .\nB : you won't draw them , or ?\nA : you can draw it , if you want .\nB : would like to see how it looks like .\nC : it may be like cow or , whatever .\nC : i'm not good very good in drawing .\nC : so this is very it's bird , .\nC : what is it .\nB : no , it's clear .\nD : that's good , it's good .\nB : it's in it's beautiful .\nB : have to remember it .\nA : so good so , let's talk about money .\nA : we are going to to sell we want to sell this remote control for twenty five euro euro .\nA : and our expected profit will be around fifty million euro .\nA : and we are trying to to have market all around the world .\nA : so not only for switzerland , but for the world .\nA : the we expect production cost of maximum twelve point fifty euro .\nB : per unit , .\nA : so we can start today to have first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ?\nA : so , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you what is your idea .\nD : from experience , i've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press .\nD : and and normally you only every use , , on t_v_ remote you only ever use , mostly , , four or six buttons .\nD : so it's frustrated me in the past , that .\nB : have also some points .\nB : first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like back light .\nB : and it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so .\nB : so something like this .\nB : and the second thing , second point from me would be that in normal remote control there is there are two buttons for volume control .\nB : but prefer like potential-meter like .\nB : some slider or not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which , but reach in one second mute it down , or or make high volume .\nD : is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that .\nA : are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can , also if when you take the the remote control , on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and you have heart attack .\nB : if it drops to the floor then it starts to scream .\nB : it depends what what you feel about that .\nB : but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that .\nA : so you can do you have something ?\nC : just simple experience .\nC : prefer remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in specific direction and then try it hard to tune .\nA : without obstacles and .\nA : have meeting in five minutes , so we should hurry .\nA : so we will close this meeting .\nA : so we will have next meeting in thirty minutes .\nA : the so will ask you to do some work .\nA : the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and read about .\nB : which which is hamed , ?\nD : he's the industrial designer ?\nD : no , you're the industrial designer .\nB : am the technical designer , which one , .\nD : that's the first .\nD : and the second one is the user interface designer .\nD : and then last one's marketing , which is me .\nB : so i'm the first one .\nA : so , for the user interface designer , which is hamed , , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control .\nA : and for the marketing manager , , , which is bob , you are going to try to to find the user requirements for the remote control .\nA : you will receive by email the specific instructions and by your personal coach .\nA : so see you in thirty minutes ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and then the marketing expert discussed user requirements. </t>  <t> The marketing expert also found that

you again .\nA : tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes .\nA : so we will see our three presentations .\nA : we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .\nD : can have the laptop over here , or ?\nA : you have to come here .\nD : have to get up .\nA : it should stay .\nA : should stay in the square here .\nD : so i'm gonna present some findings of study we conducted into what users want in this remote control .\nA : you can put it here .\nA : that's , it's jus .\nD : so first of all we what we did is we conducted an experiment with hundred test subjects .\nD : we put them in in our usability laboratory and got them to , , play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete questionnaire to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls .\nD : so the major things we found out was that users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .\nD : they , , seventy five percent of the people we we did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .\nD : they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching t_v_ .\nD : that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it .\nD : and thirdly they say that half of the users that we tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that are on remote controls .\nD : so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics based on how these test subjects were using their remote control .\nD : and from this we came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .\nD : and you can see they're used hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , , while the user's watching t_v_ .\nD : the closest button that was used , the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , , all the other , all the other buttons , such as ch audio and picture selection configuration buttons and things were used , , approx less than or equal to one times per hour .\nD : we also asked users which buttons had the most importance to them , , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control .\nD : and they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having very very high relevance .\nD : and the audio and picture settings had very that the users thought that the audio and picture settings were very weren't very important to them , and they used them very infrequently as .\nD : so we asked users what what frustrates them the most about current remote controls .\nD : and fifty percent of the users said that what frustrates them is losing the remote control somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .\nD : they also said that it it takes lot of time to learn new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's , , unintuitive interface .\nD : and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the the way that you have to hold and press buttons on remote control ar are bad and repetitive strain injury .\nD : we also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control .\nD : in particular , do they want an display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition is useful feature to have on remote control .\nD : our findings are that amongst younger age groups the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes .\nD : they want these features , they want these high technology features .\nD : ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features .\nD : whereas the the trend was as users as users became older and older they were less likely to want these features in in remote control .\nD : so it depends on where we're focusing our our market .\nD : and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , we're focusing on the younger younger target demographic , and so we should think about adding these high technology features into our remote control .\nD : that's my dic that's my presentation .\nA : so , now we can talk about user interface and about the technical function of this device .\nA : so pet peter , can you talk say something about that ?\nB : but the user user interface is responsible .\nC : you think i'm user interface manager .\nC : if could go there with this cable .\nB : you're scaring me with man .\nB : and speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very expensive .\nD : it's true , but , , they're features that users want , so it's and our production cost of twelve fifty euros per per unit is fairly high , so we can afford to to add these features into our remote .\nB : at least we have couple of months to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally .\nD : it is true .\nC : where's delete button ?\nD : that's the wrong one , .\nA : it's still bob morris .\nB : because you cancelled it .\nA : you should have put yes .\nA : click on yes .\nC : so here is my presentation about technical function design .\nC : will talk about different components and of system and how they react together .\nC : , first what is remote control ?\nC : simply it's device , as , for , for sending some commands by some waves to another device to to tell different commands with this device .\nC : and the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device .\nC : it has different blocks , different blocks .\nC : first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits making interface with keyboard and reading keyboard and reading the keyboard commands .\nC : and then inter then make these keyboard commands , in interpret these int keyboard commands .\nC : and then there should be an electronic circuit making electronic signals according to these commands and finally there is transmitter which is cord or diode making making waves to transmit through the air and this air this wave will be received by the by the other device like television or whatever , to to realise the command .\nC : about what found about different these different blocks are , usually there are two different methods to for designing remote control .\nC : they are based on infra-red waves or radio waves .\nB : you still want me the presentation .\nC : there are two different solutions .\nC : this is this can be the the differences the between different waves , infra-red or radio waves .\nC : and also as understood , and it was part of bob , presentation , people prefer to have to have the remote control with less button .\nC : so for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to try to design remote control having some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing something on t_v_ and putting less lesser on the on the remote control .\nC : and personal preferences , certainly remote control with working with radio waves is preferred because you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way .\nC : and again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as see .\nC : that was my presentation .\nD : do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home ?\nC : don't , because we can make we ca we can make this wave in specific frequency .\nC : so they can be in range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home .\nA : so can we use any any frequency ?\nB : it should be .\nA : we have the to use any frequency ?\nC : no but as know , there is range for for this for for for this , for designing this circuit .\nC : we can we can we can tune our transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission .\nA : and what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , ?\nA : and so do they have the same frequency , or ?\nC : for this i'm not the solution , but one solution can be something like putting password inside the wave , so the only your t_v_ can understand it , identification code inside the the password may simply or identification code may simply solve this problem .\nB : know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so .\nB : it's handshaking , , when starting to when you start to communicate with the your t_v_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote .\nB : so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen .\nB : can be problem sometimes , but most of the time it works .\nC : specific remote control has specific .\nB : but we we don't have to think about this because as function designer that we will use the already made circuits which we probably bu buy .\nB : it's worth to buy .\nB : and they have these problems solved so .\nB : so we don't have to think about these .\nA : so , you can talk about the function , and open .\nB : have only couple of things because had struggled bit with the software that i'm supposed to use in this in this company .\nB : was used to use linux before , so .\nB : but tried to tried to break through this too , .\nB : how to make it big ?\nA : it should work , so you can .\nB : so will speak about working design .\nB : that's the first slide .\nB : what have to do ?\nB : look at what the other company so presently am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and like that because didn't work with these circuits so far so have to look what what is available on the market for for the communication for the i_r_ circuits and so on , so i'm currently looking what is available on the web .\nB : and wanted to ask you afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , would be glad if you can tell me about them .\nB : findings , that's the point that i'm working on currently but so far was looking what what are the blue circuit , radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices read are high .\nB : so , know that the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can you can make the t_v_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but , when you are not close to the t_v_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so am am voting for to stick to the infra-red control instead of r_w_ but we will discuss it later .\nB : components to use , i'm not exactly what will use for the design of the circuit .\nB : it depends on whether we will use the and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec ?\nD : are we are we planning to take an off the shelf an o_e_m_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?\nB : no no no no no .\nB : this we this we buy , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves .\nD : so we just buy circuit board and .\nB : but i'm not about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition .\nB : this prefer that we should make ourselves .\nB : but it depends whether we take decision to use it .\nB : it's fairly expensive to use these circuits .\nB : so , speech recognition , it's because it's common nowadays to use , so agree on using any , less buttons good for me as as designer of the circuit .\nB : but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , .\nA : so what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ?\nA : or it would be feasible ?\nB : was not thinking too much about the price .\nB : but if we use the even the radio frequency communication with the t_v_ set and the backlight and related things like the photo diodes and , it should be .\nB : if we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards .\nB : it depends of you if if the m_e_ or u_i_d_ , i'm about the names , don't really know , want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and like that , so .\nB : we will discuss it afterwards .\nB : this is nothing .\nB : this is just my notes on what to use .\nB : and my personal preference is yes , would like also preferably to use r_w_ circuit , but from the point of view of the design and price , would stick to i_r_s .\nB : that's my opinion .\nB : if infra-red circuit not not the radio frequency .\nA : because it's simpler ?\nB : because because the the range where you can use it is fair .\nB : and the price is fairly cheap for this .\nA : it's price matter .\nB : jus just the price .\nB : otherwise don't care what put there because it's the chip which buy or which we buy .\nD : what how much more expensive ?\nD : are we talking three times more expensive ?\nD : or ten times more expensive ?\nB : three to three to five .\nB : not ten times , but it depends what what we .\nD : that's still lot .\nD : it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red .\nD : so it's not worth spending the extra money .\nA : on the other side , we want to have something new .\nB : they are used to use it when they can see the t_v_ so , .\nA : where we want to to have something new and so we we should still thinking about it .\nD : but , based on my usability studies feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , , the difference between infra-red or radio waves .\nD : so we're better off spending money in the usability phase .\nB : you the user interface , and management man , , that's it for me .\nA : so have to inform you receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control .\nA : first , they say that's about something about teletext .\nA : it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date .\nA : and because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .\nA : so we can avoid the teletext .\nA : the second thing is they suggest that that we should use the remote control only for t_v_ , not for d_v_d_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and because we have not much time for this project we should stay on t_v_ on the only specific t_v_ remote control .\nA : the third the third one is about the the the image of the company .\nA : so we should we should keep the the product should be recognisable .\nA : it's that mean we should use the colour of our company and put somewhere the the slogan of the company , which is , we put fashion of in electronics .\nA : so , when people see the the remote control , they should say it's from real reaction and he they should recognise the company .\nA : so , so now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this on this remote control .\nA : so , , are we going to use , speech recognition ?\nD : should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .\nD : and then we can move on to the more advanced features .\nB : so the available things are , the buttons and everything .\nB : radio frequency depends .\nB : and , the recognition it depends on you .\nA : but first what is what are the usual function of standard remote control ?\nB : you should probably speak .\nD : , the obvious one is changing channels .\nA : we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .\nA : so , turning channel , .\nB : just one note to the chan channel changing .\nB : do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?\nB : those nine plus one or two ?\nA : it would be .\nB : because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .\nA : on the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's we could think of something more betweens , like .\nB : so so we keep all these all these buttons .\nC : at least nine , ten button .\nB : like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus .\nA : something like that .\nB : or using the names and the keyboard .\nA : we could have key buttons , like discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and and inside this this thing you can move , switch .\nB : you mean like hierarchical structure .\nC : like categorising channels .\nA : if you want to see movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus .\nA : it just an idea .\nA : what you think about that but .\nB : so it requires the use of probably , to to tell you , so i'll make note on .\nD : to have some feedback .\nA : probably , , .\nD : we could also incorporate petre's idea of the slider for the volume , with the channel .\nD : so we you could quickly just through many channels .\nB : like roller for the .\nD : for the channels , perhaps .\nD : so we've got channel and volume .\nB : so we are still speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ?\nD : the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones .\nA : what about the settings of the t_v_ ?\nA : because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway .\nC : so we don't have any we don't have we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the t_v_ design or we can change some design .\nC : because one solution for this ch changing channels is to see summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can .\nB : on the screen , you mean ?\nC : not on the control , on the screen , on the t_v_ screen .\nB : not on the control , but on the screen .\nB : this would avoid , then .\nD : don't , don't but don't think we're we're the ones .\nD : this remote control we're developing is generic control for all t_v_s , .\nA : if it's possible to to watch something on t_v_ .\nB : it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the t_v_ to to to print these things .\nB : wi it will be still more expensive , but for the and this is no problem in the price .\nA : so , what are we doing with the settings ?\nA : because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so .\nA : with the we can do something with less buttons , but .\nD : but then you don't want to make the display too complicated at the same time .\nD : there's always we can always have these less often used functions hidden somewhere , under cover or at the back of under slide or some .\nB : like ma we we could have two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode .\nB : or like children and grandfather's mode , and the , the the user not the user , the man mana t_v_ manager mode .\nD : so we have five minutes left .\nD : so the settings we we are agreeing are that they're required .\nD : it's just how to .\nA : we should hide them somewhere .\nB : hide them , .\nA : in the menus of the or in the back of the remote control , like that .\nD : , what else ?\nD : power button's required .\nB : this was thinking .\nB : do we need power button ?\nB : should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ?\nB : because generally yes .\nA : it's it's setting , .\nA : it should fit in those settings functions .\nA : because it's not very current useful function .\nD : when they say power button they mean to turn the t_v_ on and off .\nA : no , it's after after five minutes timer , no ?\nB : you don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive .\nD : but if you're watching t_v_ for two hours , you don't want your t_v_ to turn off after five five minute based on our usability studies again , pe people said that the power button was very relevant button .\nB : so we should keep this button .\nD : , it was nine out of ten re relevance .\nB : so we we could what we could probably do is to keep also to keep keep the and all the buttons and , we could make it like opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the t_v_ and if you close it , it will turn off the t_v_ .\nB : if if you like this , because , t's question for you .\nD : we need to concentrate on the , , the major usage of the of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your t_v_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the t_v_ off .\nD : and all the other functionality is not used very often .\nC : they can they can be hide somewhere by cover like this .\nC : like covering cu .\nA : on the back , or for what ?\nB : like the but since we have the , we didn't need too much button too many buttons .\nC : like mobile phone covering .\nB : , just the decision of the power button .\nB : should we make it button , or some some something which would be power button .\nC : button is better .\nD : it should be bu its own button on the front .\nB : if it if it's button or .\nA : button , so .\nB : one big button .\nB : old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .\nA : so , any other suggestions or functions ?\nD : what about things like the clock and timers ?\nB : do we still have the time ?\nA : we have still one or two minutes to talk , .\nB : what what was the question ?\nC : clock or yes .\nD : , some func some features on the control to display time , or to display probably not .\nA : usually it's already on t_v_ like that .\nB : but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , no ?\nB : because if if the t_v_ turns on itself , it , if the time the timer should be there .\nA : if we if we add the time , we have to have bigger display like that , and is it very useful ?\nA : are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?\nA : this is the question .\nA : is it useful ?\nD : it's questi , it's trade-off .\nA : in my opinion we should have only useful thing and because they want the simpler it's is better .\nB : did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the t_v_ , and based on your but it can be on the display in in corner all the time on the remote .\nD : very , , very occasionally .\nD : but do use the do use the display of the time quite often , but .\nD : that's , that's true .\nD : so no time button .\nA : no time on .\nC : and do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ?\nC : thin it will not take lots of place , we just need microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this and it's not very difficult to put software inside the the electronic device and put microphone .\nC : it doesn't take that much place and also that much it doesn't cost that much .\nB : but we we should be careful about the battery life , then .\nB : if we use the speech recognition .\nA : so we think we can think more about that , and discuss that last time next time .\nA : and , now the meeting room is busy .\nA : somebody booked the meeting room just for at one p_m_ , and so we should leave .\nA : so now we are going for for small lunch .\nA : it's funded by the company .\nA : and after we have thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works .\nA : and will do the minutes .\nA : and you are going to work on your individual works .\nA : and you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on ."], ["<t> The project manager stated that the goal for the current meeting was to decide upon a concept for the remote the team is creating. </t>  <t> The marketing

this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision .\nA : so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .\nA : so , who wants to start ?\nC : no , no , you you can start .\nA : so start , .\nD : can you open my presentation , .\nD : i'm number four .\nD : can you pass the mouse , .\nD : so want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from looking at some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .\nD : the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in paris and milan .\nD : so from our market research we've come to the conclusion that fancy look and feel , as opposed to functional look and feel , is our number one priority .\nD : fancy is is is is the , , highest priority .\nD : secondly that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .\nD : so this is number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria .\nD : and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the is is important as , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .\nD : from our fashion people in paris and milan , we've discovered that this year fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .\nD : so , i'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category .\nD : and also the feel of material this year is expected to be spongy .\nD : so hopefully our remote control reflects that in some way .\nB : what does it mean , spongy ?\nB : like soft , ?\nD : soft , like like sponge .\nD : so in conclusion , we need our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , has lots of technolog tech technology in it .\nD : somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with spongy feel .\nD : and that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our fabian told us that one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of the real reaction company .\nA : easy to use , is it as much as important than technology or fancy thing .\nA : it's less important , ?\nD : so fanciness first and then two ti , half as important as that is technology technology , and half important as technology is easy to use .\nA : so , hamed , can you .\nC : the second one .\nC : could you show the presentation number three .\nB : the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .\nC : just could you check if it is the first one or the second .\nC : no , it's the first one .\nC : the second one .\nA : so it's not this one .\nC : so am going to talk about little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use .\nC : the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but , we can discuss about it later .\nC : generally , generally this remote control should be should be something , in my opinion , the first feature is just to be easy to use .\nC : so , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in good position inside the remote control .\nC : and conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it .\nC : it should be we shouldn't need to es open book and start reading and learning how to use this this remote control .\nC : so what found out that as said it's better to put more frequent ke buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size .\nC : the shape of remote control should be in way which can which should be taken easily in hand .\nC : it should not be completely like cube .\nC : it should be it should have round edge , so then it's easier .\nC : and just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand .\nC : and also because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not consume lots of energy .\nC : and my personal preference is , as said , just putting this buttons in special places and covered some buttons which are not used that much like settings button , like mobile phone .\nC : usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put volume change or ch can channel change buttons in the remote control .\nC : and if the user needed to do some more complex task he he can open the cover and then change settings like this .\nC : and also if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier .\nC : not on remote control .\nC : but just inside .\nC : sliding or rolling , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with thumb .\nC : so it can be another preference .\nC : and but usage of speech recogn recogniser can be good .\nC : know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy .\nC : and it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new .\nC : so it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it .\nC : personally think there should be big difference between between something .\nC : otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from famous company , or .\nB : so good news from me for me from hamed , but bad news from bob , because spongy design , don't like it as , so could you , fabien , open it .\nB : i'm person two .\nB : and which one , probably the first one .\nB : i'm not but check the first one .\nB : most of the things have to write myself on the board , but , that's it .\nA : this one , .\nB : just it's only this slide ?\nB : this this is just one thing wanted to mention and show you that found this , that our company developed seven seven fingers or i'll just , seven seven inch t_ t_f_t_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include display there .\nB : so probably draw it down raw scheme .\nB : this is this is the that use to , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .\nB : first thing is this will be the overall shape , no i'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .\nB : so there will be some circuit for the power .\nB : so , say power circuit here .\nB : the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can and if we decide to use the speech recognition there , we must use additional source of energy , which found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can supply everything .\nB : was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's to use just two batteries and solar cells , so .\nB : so no problem .\nB : there can be also solar cell .\nB : the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the from the design .\nB : so at least seven to seven .\nB : it depends where you put your screen , because the screen is seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it .\nB : it doesn't matter .\nB : it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere .\nB : so this will be t_f_t_ .\nB : and on the main board we have the interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here .\nB : interface to the microphone .\nB : then the graphical card for the t_f_t_ and the third unit is the i_r_ .\nB : the good news is that we can we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the inside , so it will be very cheap for us .\nB : so infra-red here .\nB : so the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the t_f_t_ which is seven inches .\nB : have to check what wanted to from my point of view don't care about the about the material used for the overall des ov all the device .\nA : can you fit any t_f_t_ or any electronic device in spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ?\nA : put electronic card on spongy thing , imagine it could be problem .\nB : all these things in in in this box are to put in in any shape , .\nB : but we have to take care of the t_f_t_ .\nB : it good feature , since it takes if it's around the t_f_t_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , .\nC : it can have two shells , hard shell inside and spongy shell outside .\nD : so so ca can ask question .\nA : put electronic in box and spongy thing around .\nB : it's related to the u_i_ .\nB : that's all from me .\nD : this seven inch t_f_t_ screen , how big is it in reality ?\nB : seven to seven inches .\nD : so like that .\nD : that's quite big .\nD : have we decided that we're gonna use this t_f_t_ screen ?\nB : but to be honest , was , honestly speaking was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches .\nA : no , don't t's seven by seven , it's seven the diagonal is seven .\nA : usually when they say seven inch it's the diagonal .\nD : but even even that is like this big .\nA : dun dun one each .\nA : but , , .\nB : but we can we can cut it .\nD : you can cut the t_f_t_ screen .\nB : no no problem , because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth .\nB : so , but no problem to to me to cut the screen .\nA : so let's cut the t_f_t_ .\nB : so so for the same price we have four screens now .\nA : these technical engineers , .\nD : so , what's the size of the device ?\nB : this is like this is almost nothing .\nB : seven to seven to at least some three millimetres .\nD : even from my perspective seven seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still is it can you hold that , or ?\nB : but we wanted the big buttons and like that , .\nB : because if it's too small we can we can lose it , at home , .\nA : what user wants .\nA : he wants small remote control , or ?\nD : small control that they can hold in hand .\nA : with big buttons .\nB : that it it should fit in the hand .\nA : sm so you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this .\nD : but is something that's seven centimetres square easy to hold ?\nB : if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and follow follow , that's that's no task for me , but seven to seven at least , but , .\nA : so we have lot we have to take decision today , so we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .\nA : first energy it's key problem because it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , , like that .\nA : because can we have and speech recognition with battery , and it's also related to the size of the of the devi of the device ?\nB : not just point to the energy things .\nB : if we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's for l_ speech recognition and , so no problem in energy , .\nB : but we have to use the solar cell .\nA : like but using how many batteries , ?\nA : are are what what is the size of the battery .\nB : was thinking just common a_a_ cells .\nB : so like three to five centimetres , exactly , but .\nD : so if we use solar cells , where is the sun if someone's watching t_v_ inside ?\nB : doesn't need to be sun .\nB : it it's just the daylight , .\nA : the television lights .\nB : suppose that suppose that that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but .\nA : at least when there is t_v_ you can get light from the t_v_ .\nB : from the t_ don't t's enough , .\nB : it's it's compromise , no ?\nA : at least it's new and technology new technology .\nB : that's why wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things .\nD : it's it's quite innovative , yes .\nD : and if you watch t_v_ outside it's very useful .\nA : so before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case .\nA : what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on .\nA : for the for the , if we choose to have small device , we cannot use this such screen .\nB : the the screen is , but the board , that's the problem .\nB : what what would you as shape ?\nB : or what what would be the shape ?\nC : their being large or small is not important .\nC : the only important thing is to be able to take it in inside hand easily .\nC : so let's say an average size , , and it should not be very heavy also .\nC : and prefer to is it shouldn't have uniform shape , so in the middle it should be little bit thinner , .\nC : so we it's like like some joysticks .\nC : you can take some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape .\nC : so the general shape should be like this .\nC : seven centimetre by seven centimetre is little bit large .\nC : so seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's it's that's my opinion .\nD : which is the same area .\nD : could you re could you redesign your board ?\nB : five to ten .\nD : five five centimetres by ten centimetres .\nB : it's feasib one how could we do it ?\nB : we could put the board next to , , under the and make the be unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand .\nB : like holding something , and the to be just on top of it , somehow .\nB : but let's stick to the spongy thing , like one unit .\nA : i've the easiest thing would be to to have smaller , if it's possible .\nB : fi five to ten it would be feasible .\nB : so five to ten , it's it's feasible .\nA : so we are agree with small .\nB : i'll make it .\nC : or or but don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it .\nB : fo five by ten .\nC : so using some l_c_d_s we can touch , so we can remove keys and just having , the name , responding to fingers .\nC : touching the screen .\nC : something like like tactile .\nA : touch screen , .\nC : so but for now if we don't want to use such screens we using smaller screen is better , because smaller .\nA : the problem is we have limit in month of time , so we cannot do something very new .\nA : so let's go for small .\nD : so t's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .\nB : so , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and will work it out .\nA : so , five by ten .\nA : so what about , so the case we talked about .\nA : something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ?\nA : my first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in hand , about banana , like that , which is fruits , and big banana .\nB : seven to ten banana .\nB : rather mango or .\nD : what other what other fruit and vegetables do of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ?\nA : but it's just an idea .\nA : what you think about , but .\nA : if it can fit with the technology .\nA : you are the specialists of that .\nB : you mean banana .\nB : but if it's if it if the banana is big enough .\nB : then , yes .\nA : so , and the screen has to be square ?\nB : but if you want to look at the screen , no .\nB : ll , it can be whatever you want .\nC : this is not good .\nA : or it can be like shape , quite , with curves .\nB : but if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just .\nB : but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .\nB : it's like more more expensive to have shape like that .\nB : but don't care .\nB : if we fit this requirement .\nD : 'd like shaped screen .\nD : that's more important than saving bit of money on on the t_f_t_ screen .\nB : the banana could be like bit fatter than than the common one .\nA : it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to to be really the size and exactly the shape of banana .\nB : but like modified banana , .\nB : we'll stick to banana , or ?\nA : so we are agree with the banana thing ?\nA : so , the last point we decided it's infra-red , .\nA : so that's it about the concepts .\nA : you have other thing to add to this point , or no ?\nA : so , about the user interface , so we are going to use .\nA : in the last meeting we talked about hidden buttons .\nA : what we are going to do with that .\nA : you talked about the buttons on the side what ?\nB : like like peeling of the banana you it would be , .\nC : peeling of the banana .\nB : peeling of the banana , , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .\nA : and you mean the first layer would be spongy .\nB : first layer spo , it's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , .\nA : so is it is it possible to do that ?\nA : it would be idea , but is it possible technically ?\nA : like doing spongy layer of the banana , and you open it .\nD : if we if we have spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , , to manipulate that to hav be cover that you can pull off and for .\nC : some something like plastic cover covering some interface , u_s_b_ interface as in the in digital camera .\nC : if you see it's like peeling .\nC : you open plastic cover and you see some u_s_b_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor .\nC : so keys can be buttons can be covered like this , with plastic cover and when and when you open this cover it's like peeling banana .\nC : so , something like this .\nA : but do you see that as rigid thing , or like like banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .\nB : it possible to make it soft ?\nC : , it's lic like plastic cover , so .\nB : so if it's so then it's ?\nA : so , what you think , bob , but it would be for users , and very good for marketing .\nD : the softer the better .\nB : honestly speaking , not imagine it , so far , but it will be terrible .\nA : and setting buttons hidden in .\nA : other remarks , , or .\nA : something we didn't talk about yes yet , or .\nA : we are almost there .\nA : how can we , if we have soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , how to do that technically , or .\nA : and how , .\nD : we could use velcro .\nD : or ma magnetic thing .\nC : yes , it's good idea .\nC : or it can is it can be plastic cover sticking to the to the all the like with magnetic magnetic magnetic materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .\nC : and when you try to open it , it will be opened easily .\nC : so you you can be that it will not be open while you're while while you are commonly using buttons on the banana .\nA : and what would be the matter here of the first layer ?\nA : soft plastic , or , , .\nD : imagine some vinyl thing .\nD : in in with suede feel .\nB : since since the since the things like the like the screen and how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot so we need that the that the peeling but we should we should take care of these two two things .\nB : so , if if the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , .\nB : so that we can reach the energy out of it out of that .\nD : so you're saying is it possible to have solar cell and this removable cover and and and banana .\nB : it is possible , but , it .\nB : how to how to do it if if if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the to the peeling or outside it , or or inside .\nB : but then it must be some window there , .\nA : and something we forgot , , about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ?\nA : it , it seems feasible , and it would be something very .\nD : one of our priorities is tech technology .\nA : so we have the de design , the good shape , new and so on , and we have also the technology thing will be .\nA : and even the easy to use thing , so it will be perfect .\nA : so we add also the speech recognition device .\nA : so , that .\nA : we have decided everything .\nA : and think we are on good way .\nA : so , the next meeting will start in thirty minutes .\nA : so the the industrial manager will will work on the look and feel design .\nA : the user interface mana manager will work on the user interface device .\nA : and the the marketing expert will do the first project evaluation .\nA : so , hope you can do that in thirty minutes .\nA : and , , you should work together , you hamed and peter , to work in in first prototype , and more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together .\nA : and as usual you will receive some specific instructions on .\nA : so all everybody , and see you in thirty minutes ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members. </t>  <t> The team members then participated in an exercise in

</t> ", "A : so , hello everyone .\nA : we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control .\nA : i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin .\nA : so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting .\nA : so we want to to do new remote control .\nA : it has to be original , trendy and user friendly .\nA : the important points we have to talk about are it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design .\nA : and for that we're going all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day .\nA : so let's try the whiteboard .\nA : so any of you who want to go .\nB : for favourite animals .\nB : it's gonna be not my favourite one but the one draw .\nB : and it's gonna be you'll try to .\nB : yes , that's rabbit .\nB : that's my favourite one .\nD : rabbit , , where is the carrot ?\nA : you want to go ?\nD : am not very good at this .\nD : my favourite animal is .\nC : you wa is the white .\nD : human , yay .\nD : it's very complex animal and .\nD : characteristics of this this animal is dangerous .\nA : you're supposed to , .\nB : no , it just small cobra , .\nA : is that worm ?\nB : it's co quite recognisable .\nA : or christa pavlov .\nD : what about you christa ?\nD : so , whiteboard is working ?\nA : let's talk about money .\nB : just tr try to who is user interface designer .\nB : according to the drawings .\nD : twenty five euro for remote control .\nA : that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control .\nA : we aim to do this profit .\nD : 'tis big number .\nB : on the international market .\nC : we're to sell two million then .\nA : for production cost of twelve fifty euros maximum .\nA : so any of you have experience in remote controls ?\nD : yes , we have plenty at home .\nD : my daughter likes remote controls .\nA : that so that could be application .\nD : mainly , and to break .\nA : remote controls children proof .\nD : so she likes buttons which make click , so it has to click .\nA : so they have to be waterproof ?\nD : it has to be wha baby proof but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's high enough so that when she throw it away it's so it has to be very robust .\nA : 'cause they eat she ate it .\nC : we have some child lock , .\nD : and it has to be looking , colourful , colourful , because nobody has colourful remote control , they're always black , , but this one could be , purple or , .\nB : that's not practical .\nA : no , that's good idea .\nC : it's always black or .\nB : but how gonna , just but it's monochrome it's it's not like otherwise you will never find it .\nA : no , because you think , why not .\nC : even we can change colours , no ?\nC : like the like the phones and these things we .\nD : like the phones , , it could change colours , .\nC : at least for children like one colour and .\nB : ch , but without any extremes like not of this size , not too large .\nC : and it should be really small and .\nA : don't you think no , not too much buttons or .\nC : not so big like .\nC : not too much buttons and .\nD : should it be , these remote controls where they are what they call universal ret remote control so you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever if it's or if we should have targeted re remote control .\nA : so , there's so you you t's better if small than bigger .\nD : so colour , robustness , easy to use , size , , size matters , .\nC : colour , size , sh , at least not bigger than this .\nA : no , not too small , .\nC : at least it should hold in your hand properly , like .\nB : like palm sized .\nB : just to hold it .\nD : but what would be different from this , from the others ?\nD : if , at least the colour would be different .\nC : we can change the colours that at least the frame .\nC : so then it depends you are to you you can easily remove the frame .\nD : one thing important in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find good button in the place .\nD : for some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the so there's problem in the design of that remote control somehow , .\nA : so , some idea with cellular phone with screen that will tell you what no .\nB : no , no screens , it's too complex .\nD : too expensive for twelve euro ?\nC : too expensive , .\nB : and not too expensive , t's not my problem , but .\nA : and too expensive .\nB : but no screens on remote controls .\nD : it could be only screen which would change depending on the use or even the user .\nD : so ma prefer to have the off button at the top , so would have my own design of the remote control because it's just full touch screen remote control , if you if you like .\nC : it it's like it's like two types no ?\nD : if it makes sense , but , , .\nC : people are handed or left handed so because am left handed use like this , say if you're handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on .\nA : so adaptable something .\nD : if if it's possible , .\nB : alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?\nC : even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working .\nC : we can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if i'm left-hander use this switch to follow the main operations .\nB : if it's less than three then we can make it like like three mental states , what , we can just make it controlled by brain , ?\nD : three buttons you mean ?\nA : if it's more , if there is software inside that ask you three .\nA : if it if we want universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three three button , three possibilities , ye .\nD : more than three actions that you may want to do at given time .\nB : but for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .\nD : but when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .\nD : and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five .\nB : you do this ?\nB : usually just change channels .\nD : because i'm only using three or four channels but and then back to the one was before , so there's whichever it was .\nC : but they keep generally their slash slash this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put , you can only have one bit .\nA : change channel like this , want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , .\nA : also we can be here , that would be .\nB : go back button is good .\nD : we had that in in other countries .\nB : once had it .\nC : the previous button is .\nD : even the history so you could like undo previous of the previous .\nD : then you can watch what your you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what the other people have used there or remote controls .\nC : what the which channels the viewer marketing .\nA : so we have full of idea .\nA : we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and want you to work on these ideas and try to make the ones , make to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want .\nA : and more in the technical parts what do we want to do .\nA : so your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .\nD : so what does m_e_ means ?\nD : m_e_ the user requirements ?\nD : or that's that's for us ?\nD : , the user requirement specifications , , .\nD : i'll think of that .\nA : see you in thirty minutes ."], ["<t> The project manager opened

ready for this functional design meeting .\nA : so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation .\nA : we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good .\nA : how to to design this this .\nA : so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert .\nD : so if do that like this ?\nD : so it's being modified .\nD : do you want , open .\nD : hope saved it .\nD : so , , this is my name .\nB : know this name .\nB : we met before .\nD : so as , you you already know me , sammy benjo .\nD : am the expert in marketing and want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls , and hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly .\nC : it is put five .\nC : the full page presentation , .\nD : in the full page because spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .\nD : so what suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be good remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful .\nD : don't forget about that .\nD : so we've we've conducted survey on on the use of remote controls and i'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey .\nD : so what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls .\nD : first of all , they find it very ugly .\nD : current remote controls as they're the same as this one they're not colour , not shape , they're all the same , and they're not good looking .\nD : what is interesting is that it seems that they were people are ready to pay for and look and fancy looking remote control , so we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that .\nD : and the other thing is that the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .\nD : we see that they zap very often so this is very important functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap in one way or another .\nD : and most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used , so we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only couple of people are using .\nD : now people are very frustrated with their remote controls and they they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is .\nD : if we have something where we could ask the remote control , where are you ?\nD : like something to to like phones .\nD : some of the phones have some of this functionality .\nD : phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control .\nC : you can you are .\nD : but why not ?\nD : and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they how to they to use properly their remote controls .\nD : and they are bad for r_s_i_ but don't remember what is r_s_i_ .\nD : so they are bad .\nA : tha that's look .\nD : nobody has any idea about that ?\nD : 'll check with my , , it's technical thing which our .\nC : it's electromagnetic waves effect .\nB : no , don't .\nC : because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high .\nD : so , it seems that it's lot of people for concept that we but we have to take this into account .\nB : but twenty six percent , do twenty five .\nB : every fourth , .\nC : it's people really .\nB : every four some of us knows .\nD : so anyway that's for what the biggest frustration of the user and what else do have ?\nB : one of us .\nD : so we've listed couple of functions that may be used by the user in the current available remote controls and the tables look very to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant .\nD : people want to have power button .\nD : channel selection is often used very often used and very relevant .\nD : now remember what is r_s_i_ it's repetitivity stress injury .\nD : we have to be careful with that word but anyway continue my presentation so , channel selection is very important , very often used .\nD : volume is not often used but people want to have control on volume and that makes sense .\nD : and then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings .\nD : audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .\nD : all of them .\nD : they're not often used and they are more or less relevant .\nD : it seems that people find teletext teletext relevant , even if personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\nA : have been told that we don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .\nD : tell you that in in scale between one and ten relevant not relevant to relevant people scored six on this , which is not as these these two one were had ten .\nD : but but if you compare with these ones , they scored one or two .\nD : not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's but just know that people find it somehow relevant .\nD : that's for the main functions and then we can ask ourself what people don't have that may be useful .\nD : net next slide .\nD : one of the thing the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .\nD : so we've conducted survey about whether people would like or not to have this functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age .\nD : young people , probably because it's buzz word , find it very relevant .\nD : and as the age goes up the the relevance goes down .\nD : so now it really depends on the targeting wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\nD : if we are targeting young people then it's probably something we have to consider .\nD : if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really why they this should be so now this is , depends on that .\nD : and don't have any conclusion , didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's my findings .\nD : and , if you have any question ?\nA : it's good , .\nA : you done good review .\nB : got one question , you are market expert so should we aim at the young people or not ?\nD : one question , ?\nD : we should aim at the young people .\nD : but they are they are those who might be more interested in in new device .\nD : in general the the early adopters of new device are young people , less than more than then teletext is useless for them , .\nB : then teletext is used less .\nD : because they they have other means of finding their information .\nA : that's good point .\nA : so now it's the turn of the the i'm not of the technical function , so what effect .\nD : so it's you , ?\nC : it's techni function of .\nD : no , user requiremen makes sense .\nC : have to do working design so .\nB : that's but this but number three , yes .\nB : so , my name is mark dwight , and am responsible for user interface design .\nB : however , project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .\nB : as i'm more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\nB : so next slide .\nB : and general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about occam razor .\nB : we should never complicate things too much .\nB : we should only make remote control , nothing more .\nB : nothing more than this , just remote control .\nB : 'cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\nB : so , make click , .\nB : so here is this remote control .\nB : it's quite standard one , but it's not from t_v_ , it's from much easier device like air conditioning .\nB : but , we can use it for t_v_ easily .\nB : only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and some options else , and make click , compared to this one which one would you prefer ?\nD : would say the simplest one as long as there are the find the buttons that need every time need button .\nC : it can be middle of like , between those two li you should .\nB : and our method is going to be , provide simple simple desires into simple actions .\nB : our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .\nB : be simple and you'll lean on this market .\nB : market is of remote controls it better , it's very , it's it's not an easy field to to play , ?\nB : so be simple .\nB : for personal preferences that to make baby-proof remote control it got to be titanium .\nB : it's really good style , it going to be look like like this .\nB : it is unbreakable and it is very universal .\nB : we'll have screen with back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen .\nB : we'll need only few buttons .\nB : all the other things can be controlled through the screen .\nB : and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch movie and you want to change something , you always try to find good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch .\nB : so press would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , screen with back light which can change colours , titanium , and what else ?\nB : got just very few and good ideas .\nB : we need power and volume .\nB : and let us include two features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic .\nB : when you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the t_v_ , the t_v_ turns on .\nD : and when does it turn off ?\nB : when you don't touch the control but you go out of the for for enough time like you it's question to our technical design , our two engineers .\nD : so you have sensing sensor machine that knows tech .\nB : and another feature that would like to implement is volume control .\nB : suppose you set you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you .\nB : like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa , and then the volume changes .\nA : or you want to go to the kitchen .\nB : it's easy to do , you just control the according to the distance .\nD : according to your distance to and the angle , if you have stereo system .\nD : i'm not about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ?\nB : so it can be just menu which can be controlled with left , , up , down and enter .\nD : is it touch screen by the way ?\nD : so it gives instructions but it has to be with an back light somehow .\nB : so , its main purpose is back light , which change colours , which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to find it easily , ?\nB : so that's it .\nA : see that you target several application not only t_v_ but like we talk about universal remote control .\nB : can be easily done , 'cause you got simple designs , we should put it to simple actions .\nB : let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system .\nB : you want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .\nB : just few actions , few actions for everything .\nB : all the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .\nA : since we were targeting really soon date for the the the issuing of this remote control we will only concentrate on t_v_ for the moment and then make it more generalised .\nB : but it's quite universal .\nB : we can just extend it to any device .\nD : so if want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would do can do that with this ?\nD : let's say am on channel eight now .\nD : these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels .\nB : would propose another solution .\nD : or is it ?\nB : you use just four or five channels , ?\nB : so set up your t_v_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to twenty fives channel .\nD : in in one remote control that i've seen , instead of doing that you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and sixty four are those that want to by cycled with my next button .\nA : it's it's the same solution , .\nC : but even we can have some display , like you can de you can just button the number and then it go because .\nD : go to channel twenty five .\nD : one thing is that as said in my presentation people really do like to zap .\nD : so even if they are only watching four or five channels , they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , just because this is one thing they do , zapping .\nA : on zap it's only next next next next next , .\nD : and it's only next .\nD : so but you have to .\nB : we got these buttons here .\nB : or say this can be back .\nC : but otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then .\nD : so it would be .\nA : we can make different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or current chan .\nC : but since we are focusing only on t_v_ remote controls so we can have more functions for t_v_ if you want to go for universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\nB : could we carry out some research if we really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\nD : could could have look at that .\nD : i'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that .\nB : for your attention .\nA : so now the technical aspects of this new device .\nA : you prefer it .\nC : as , am mister ramaro .\nC : am an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices and previously devised many like digital calculators and electronic calculators .\nC : so now i'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control .\nC : as the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like t_v_ or v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player etcetera .\nC : so we will have portable device which will send message to the the main device like t_v_ .\nC : so we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .\nC : and usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which some pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack like that .\nC : and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device .\nC : it's generally in the form of infrared or some sensor information .\nC : then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want .\nC : so , we need since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like the keypad and buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are am one doing mostly digital devices we ought to have some processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format .\nC : and then we'll have the infrared l_e_d_ source which sends the information to the main device .\nC : then we'll have switch in our main device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different t_v_s , so some t_v_s will have different encryption codes for doing channel changing and these things .\nA : to make it quite an universal device .\nC : because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .\nC : so we need to check their specifications and do their encryption that's passing information to the t_v_ device .\nC : so we need to have particular encryption codes .\nC : then , components , so we have the main energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device .\nC : since don't have much time so i'll input the connections to all this components .\nC : and since also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\nA : and from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or .\nC : i'm , because since our user interface speech recognition and also marketing expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like simple speech recogniser on our d_s_b_ chip .\nC : since we have some energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put the small simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just , so that we just use simple recog no but but .\nA : on train it , .\nD : but very very good to sell .\nC : no , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , .\nD : think of all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me .\nA : and what about the price of this component ?\nC : so we can make it in five euros and even less than that , because we want to have millions and in bulk , so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this we'll have volume and then we will have particular channel , so users can listen .\nD : the user will just be able to say can you pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\nC : ye no , , user can use any sender but they should have this prompt volume and then volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and .\nA : with keywords and .\nD : couple of words .\nC : and then we can have channel they can say , want eight , because we like users have different programmes , they don't really follow same channels strict so we just want channel number , we don't want like b_b_c_ or c_n_n_ else because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three main basic anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , it's it it will be take care of our main .\nD : it has to be .\nB : no it's conceptual question , 'cause now see this the picture in front of my eyes like user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , and and he's coming , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down .\nD : but then you you first of all this is not functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\nA : no , in no not only speech , .\nD : it's on top of using the button .\nB : for this budget like twelve euros .\nA : it's an option .\nC : actually we we can have one switch to like switch on , on and off , this processor and this really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this d_s_p_s .\nC : again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use d_s_p_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key .\nC : so it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on t_v_ remote control so and we have only few things here .\nA : sho to to train , .\nB : did you consider the gest gesture recognition ?\nB : like , if want to put volume up like do take my remote control do like something like roll up or roll down .\nC : this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because our target is only like twelve point five euros and , even automatic on off is also bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really they just they don't touch the remote and you how much time you need to switch on or switch off and yay .\nD : very expensive , no ?\nA : and , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , .\nB : that's just we got really good market expert .\nD : and volume control .\nD : so but sh should we target user personalised remote control ?\nD : so in in given room there might be more than one remote control .\nD : we would have each one and with our own personal settings .\nC : that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say , suppose they're watching tennis match then they can say after one hour they can make we can have .\nA : wouldn't that make arguments ?\nA : want and we can increase this the strength you can buy one with .\nD : that's no problem , we will sell more .\nB : let's send more , let's sell more .\nA : you have something else to say ?\nC : not very much , like .\nA : so , , we're just on time .\nC : can you just .\nA : so , we're now going to have the lunch break .\nA : then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and we will meet again for the next meeting , and in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the on the components so you will focus on the component concept the u_i_d_ mark will be focused on the user interface concept and our market expert sammy benjo on the trend watching .\nC : mark will it's in current price , .\nA : so like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach .\nA : and we have we have to we say , only for t_v_ , not teletext ?\nA : automatic on off control it's not possible .\nA : in the next step if we make it work .\nC : but speech recogniser can be possible .\nA : we can think about that .\nA : and do you see something else ?\nB : should it be equipped with the , with speakers ?\nD : speakers in the remote cont .\nB : like , you want to find it , you shout control , and it answers is i'm here ?\nA : that's or you want to phone him .\nB : or just beeps ?\nD : it just beeps .\nD : that would be enough .\nD : something very cheap .\nD : but that's ex that's expensive .\nA : since now all ?\nC : especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on and .\nD : heard of devices where you just whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\nA : and and it's answered .\nB : no , no , 't .\nD : you can't whistle .\nA : clap clap clap it's good it's universal .\nD : you can clap .\nD : clap is good .\nD : tak just suggestion .\nA : what about people without hand ?\nD : with only one hand ?\nD : these are not our target people .\nC : but it's good feature we need to think about more how to incorporate it .\nB : just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .\nD : that's that already exists .\nB : got it at my home , like .\nD : you do have .\nA : so let's to think so that .\nD : think about it .\nA : that could be in the component concept .\nD : good we're done ?\nA : so , , let's go to lunch ."], ["<t> The project manager stated the agenda and set the goals for the current meeting. </t>

", "A : so now we are on the conceptual design meeting .\nA : getting close to the last is the penultim meeting .\nB : how was lunch ?\nD : don't be sarcastic .\nA : so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy .\nA : we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .\nA : so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case .\nA : and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements .\nA : and at the end sammy will give trend watching on what he's he's been doing .\nA : it's so , let's go .\nA : first with rama .\nC : so we're to mainly design mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface .\nC : for energy there are two or three possibilities .\nC : first one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this r_s_a_ and then titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal display .\nC : and we can use some , moving thing .\nC : so , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition chip in our remote control .\nC : so this can be simple programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors .\nC : and we also want to look at our remote control , so .\nC : still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve euros or around that .\nC : so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in room or in house .\nC : so we discussed an excuse me .\nC : so we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery .\nC : and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nD : what is double-curved shape ?\nC : like you can have two curves .\nC : it's in manufacturing it's problematic .\nC : so , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need simple chip and it's really lesser re really less expensive compared to which are which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce cost .\nA : want to know why it just but for the point before why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nC : and also like in if you put it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and .\nA : you titanium it's more yes so .\nB : we can use something like the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to .\nC : like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and .\nC : but full assembly we'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes .\nC : and this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s and so we want to mo we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so so it's like we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter , that can we we can consider , because like it won't take much money , because , .\nA : so , so simple button and speech recognition for the more complicated .\nB : and still we have can we still include the l_ l_s_d_ display ?\nD : seems not , it's either or push-button .\nB : no , it's not gonna be no touchable but still like source of information or source for menus .\nB : so let's try it , let's , , it's it's not gonna be touch pad , just display for giving you information .\nD : the would the display would only be display and not touch sensitive you mean .\nD : just for output , .\nC : you have any further questions or ?\nD : so the batteries are going to be very light .\nC : we're to go for li and now we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with good price .\nD : so this device on that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just the finding it , instead of clapping why not just be ask .\nC : that's then the the one thing we want to like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it at least five , six people want to use it so so how to how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do speaker independent or speaker dependent .\nC : if we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really more technology and so , if if everybody in the house to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology .\nA : for the location .\nA : so let's now go to the you don't have more question ?\nD : no , it's .\nB : no more questions .\nD : puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that .\nD : we have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible .\nC : we have some limitations .\nB : but still l_s_d_'s already quite , l_c_ i'm an artist , .\nD : l_s_d_ is something else , and it's quite as .\nD : so , go on artist .\nB : so , that's not hope that's not too much .\nA : now let's talk about interface .\nB : participant number three .\nB : have look at this no it's .\nB : so the concept of the interface .\nB : generally developed quite broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and all the complex things that come together with your t_v_ and remote controls .\nB : so let's start with this .\nB : we got our perfect remote control with lot of buttons and we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and it will take some days to learn all this buttons and the is going to be somewhere here and go back button , really where it is , one of this buttons , and power on and off don't remember so it it it should be this button is power on and off ?\nB : so that's our concept .\nB : it's called the millennium remote control .\nD : let's change millenniums .\nC : so you can use in the end and .\nD : doesn't make sense .\nD : this is very ugly .\nB : you like it .\nD : no , too much concept .\nB : just press the button , .\nB : we will not use this .\nB : we will not use this .\nB : but instead of this will devise that's our concept .\nB : and it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this we already we already discussed .\nB : and what will people say ?\nB : they'll say it's perfect .\nB : or what will say ?\nB : they will say it's splendid .\nB : and everyone will say i'll buy it .\nB : and everyone's gonna be satisfied .\nD : do you can come in several colours ?\nD : or did the but not the case .\nB : would make backlight of the screen with different colours .\nB : not the case .\nD : the case would only be in that aluminium titanium , like , they like something which is , , so that would be the option .\nA : because from your survey people like colours , no ?\nB : so let's remember there's nokia phone which changeable panels .\nB : do you like it ?\nD : don't have nokia phone , but don't use that but again , might , bu but .\nC : but it's but it would be expensive , no ?\nB : that's why you don't have it .\nB : that's why , 'cause it's nasty .\nC : if you use colour .\nC : instead of that we can change the colour of the assembler .\nC : we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly .\nC : so users have different they have their own interests , colour interests and so so we can just if they want they can just pay another two euro .\nA : , so you you propose something with option that increase the price if we if you want more colours on , .\nC : if they want like so that we can .\nD : upgradable remote control .\nC : just they'll get few more things and few more colours .\nB : what there's one more decisi one more solution , 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , .\nA : and thermodynamic also .\nB : we can make it .\nA : but that's mo too much expensive , .\nB : if if if the .\nA : but it can be in in an gradable version , but .\nD : because there are two kinds of people .\nD : those for which the remote control is is to be something useful i'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that is specific to them so it it's like signature .\nD : my remote control is pink .\nD : nobody else than me has pink remote control .\nD : and that makes me special .\nA : and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of or this is , so so it's not base service it's .\nD : they would be ready ready to pay more for that .\nD : those who wanted to have it pink .\nB : so , be an option , .\nD : it might be optional , .\nC : but those people will be really few , no ?\nC : so like we can those .\nD : the the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .\nD : although similar but have something just slightly better .\nA : so so that's if that it's selling point it has to be the base .\nB : but if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .\nB : and it makes you different , ?\nA : and you'll be different .\nD : you always have your remote .\nA : in the train , hello no .\nB : anyone has their remote controls here ?\nD : you don't have your remo wh you like take the ipod .\nA : want to change my neighbour .\nD : it's remote control .\nD : it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere .\nD : it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's colour that we don't usually see in remote control .\nB : could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?\nB : that they can use it in darkness , like .\nD : glow in the dark , so .\nB : hand light , .\nC : like the infrared like we can put some radium chips so that like at least .\nB : let's go on with the presentation .\nB : and the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?\nB : and that's question to you and to to .\nD : so heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done so that's the smartness of the thing .\nD : currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .\nB : so just just just just think about it .\nD : don't touch the remote .\nD : are are you saying here that the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ?\nD : so the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want .\nB : want to say it should be real smart .\nD : like with some fingerprint recognition or .\nB : voice recognition is quite tough .\nB : say don't use it , and the control just looks .\nB : 'cause ordered jus to to lock it .\nC : that that could be feasible , like so since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition so we can use .\nD : so it could be smart in that way .\nD : but i'm thinking about the other particularity that the the remote control could have .\nD : since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the channels you are more often using and levels of volumes that you're more often things like that and provide you ways of using them , , somehow , , that might be expensive but that might also be good sales pitch again .\nD : the remote that knows you .\nA : so it's , marketing expert .\nD : so i'm going to talk about trends and hope this can help us to to understand how we should design our remote control .\nD : so , next slide .\nD : so first just small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so simple you might think that it's easy but it's not so simple .\nD : anyway these days the best source of information is the web as , so have to to go often on the web and look at what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day or any other tool that is similar to remote control which is small device that people have with them , always , like phone .\nD : we can we can use the phone as as good example of where to in be inspired .\nD : those tha who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend .\nD : hope i'm going to try to help you on that .\nD : this is more risky because you're not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make lot of money or you don't and you're out of business .\nD : so anyway next slide .\nD : to be to be quick there's lot of words here but there are in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to .\nD : the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have fancy look and feel .\nD : and interestingly this is the very most important thing .\nD : it has to be fancy .\nD : strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically innovative , it has to be new with some of new technology inside and and this is also more important than the last thing which we may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as remote control .\nD : so as you see it first have to be very , something that people are proud of that they can be id identified with and and then something that contains very novel that they can talk about with their friends , , mine has this and not yours .\nD : and finally it has to be useful as remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as remote control .\nD : and now in more general broad way of seeing the thing .\nD : if we look back and not look at only remote controls it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in in big cities like paris and milan , , it seems that this year things should have fruit and vegetable way of of look or feel or so .\nD : and it applies to everything .\nD : that's the thing with trends .\nD : it it can travel from clothe to furniture same idea .\nD : fruit and vegetable .\nD : think fruit and vegetable .\nD : and if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , .\nB : what is spongy ?\nD : this so so when we were talking about rubber , the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .\nA : so titanium it's not good idea .\nD : seems not , seems not .\nC : we need to think about .\nD : so think more of something in the colours of like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as even in the shape it has to be more round and more look natural somehow .\nA : it seems to be .\nD : and not those futuristic remote control with angles and and titanium like .\nD : so that's what people seem to t's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and that's all have to say .\nA : you have questions ?\nC : so these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ?\nC : or it's this you you so did you where ?\nD : we have people listening to the trends everywhere in the world , , as our company is quite big and so i'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask their friends that are also .\nC : it's not from .\nC : it's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control .\nD : no , it's not it's not this this is very general , .\nD : but it seems that trends travel across things .\nD : the what we .\nC : but some materials they're to be they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or .\nD : we have to we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside , so .\nC : sponge , at least that's that .\nD : this is your problem .\nD : this is not mine .\nC : these things can be easily incorporated .\nC : we can have colours or this shape or at least .\nD : in the colours and in the the material .\nD : if if it's something like rubber made or it it's also going to be good .\nA : no more question ?\nA : so we will have next meeting in thirty minutes again .\nA : now you have to go straight on this individual action which which are for rama wil design , mark the user interface design , and sammy the product evaluation .\nC : look and feel de .\nA : you will work together on new on on prototype using modelling clay .\nA : and as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .\nC : so , can we highlight the specific features of our , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend .\nA : you're , you have to so you say do we agree on that ?\nA : we have to .\nC : so , do you think .\nB : so we have to for so are we confident enough on creating trends ?\nD : no , we don't have to , but seems it's the trend .\nD : again , as said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .\nD : so there's no , that's you can try to convince us .\nB : we can make it smell like fruit .\nA : that's good idea .\nC : that's so what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ?\nD : that's good idea , it's again in this what said first it has to be fancy so if nobody else pro provides currently remote control with that and if we can provide it it's good sell for us because we have it and others don't .\nA : so titanium smell like fruit .\nC : or they really like they more want these fancy features like feature .\nD : whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important .\nA : agree with this now we have to decide on what fanciness .\nA : do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy fruity-like .\nC : we will try to explore these two options and .\nD : you could explore the two option .\nB : could we make titanium shape ?\nC : at least like we can make banana or it's it's that's we're to look for and and we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and .\nA : don't you say that you cannot do double shape curved shape .\nB : but doub double-curved .\nD : seems to be .\nB : to make to make the like titanium panels on whole rubber body .\nA : so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\nA : or or spongy an .\nC : we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one titanium .\nC : we have only the plastic or the the chippy fibre chips or .\nD : if you have time .\nA : don't think we have to choose .\nA : if we choose titanium or if we choose spongy but it cannot be both .\nB : really don't like this modelling clay 'cause it makes some for for we'll look .\nA : you can pretend that it's titanium .\nD : you can paint it afterward .\nD : we have very large department of paint .\nA : do don't worry , you you you speak with .\nD : you will do it .\nB : alright , alright .\nA : so explore shape .\nC : so still we want to keep ?\nA : it's what we say , that we have an an with information .\nD : the thing is that if we want to have as he says if we want to have small number of buttons we need to have output that says currently what their actions are .\nC : then we can , , that user friendly or .\nD : that's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing .\nC : and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or , because .\nD : classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent the wheel .\nD : anyway it's very in general people change t_v_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\nD : because the trend goes faster than the life of the so it's very .\nA : so are we .\nA : so see you in thirty minutes ."], ["<t> This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. </t>  <t> It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. </t>  <t> It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. </t>  <t> It was designed to be powered by a single battery. </t>  <t> The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. </t>  <t> The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. </t>  <t> Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo. </t>  <t> When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget. </t>  <t> The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval. </t>  <t> Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager. </t>  <t> The prototype was more than 40% over budget. </t>  <t> The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype. </t> ", "D : so , hi christa .\nA : so , now it's the hi sammy .\nA : it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting .\nA : so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype .\nA : then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .\nA : then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team .\nA : and that's all .\nA : so first , let's see the prototype .\nC : here we have our prototype model .\nA : and you have some slides then ?\nC : we have also some slides .\nB : yes , and place some slides .\nA : so in which .\nB : so this is our remote control .\nB : it's working prototype .\nB : you can use it now by switching all these buttons .\nB : so first , present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications .\nB : that's , so that's that .\nB : we analysed all the fruits and contacted nasa , and made some real good .\nB : if you can see this , and the stars are showing that .\nB : and , society will accept that .\nB : and making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and ultimate smell of it .\nB : but we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the the modern material we can select .\nB : and it's practical .\nB : and it's still say it's for our needs , so press something .\nB : and as said , it's perfect .\nC : explanat see this .\nB : everyone is really really glad to obtain an such such device .\nB : so you can touch it with your hands .\nC : you can spongy .\nA : what do you say ?\nB : you must say it .\nD : it says will i'll buy it .\nD : if if need so .\nD : hopefully my daughter will like it .\nB : and we got the answer .\nB : it is , yes , .\nB : this is prototype .\nB : you can have look at it , and that's all wanted to say .\nB : now it's technical specification by our colleague .\nD : there is button missing .\nC : this this is really flexible .\nC : you can add your buttons .\nD : it's in option .\nC : so function , so , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want .\nC : and so , we have buttons and using , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the , and then do on and off .\nC : then you ha you'll have volume control .\nC : so , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .\nC : and we have some controls .\nC : like , switching the display if you want to use , or you don't want you can just use normal button .\nC : and we have speech recognition .\nC : here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .\nC : and it can also do the action .\nC : and location finder .\nC : and we want to do the location using speech recogniser .\nC : you can just say , where is my remote control .\nC : or , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like bobby .\nC : and then , it will say hi .\nC : hi , and then you can use it .\nC : so , our team is now fruits .\nC : so , you can have and then you can see the look and all the switches .\nD : these are strawberries .\nC : material , we want to stick to titanium .\nC : we will send , we want to , or so , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like shown in these phones .\nD : fruit smelling spongy titanium .\nD : didn't exist , but that's .\nC : you can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs .\nC : and you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .\nD : you mean we can change the colour of .\nA : that's for the or for the titanium ?\nC : with titanium it's it is silver .\nD : tit titanium is , .\nB : we are still working on titanium .\nB : so , we'll start with .\nB : you can ask bob .\nA : you're theme today .\nC : even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or and you can have many colours on weekends .\nD : black for sunday .\nA : and , wh what are the strawberries for ?\nC : these are like sensors .\nD : what do you think ?\nB : that's location sensors .\nC : so , after this meeting we'll propose party for our success for so , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , let us know .\nB : and we can just some strawberry first .\nC : so , any specific questions for .\nA : we'll see in the financial part if all gets into who is the five fifty millions we first make party in ?\nD : it makes sense .\nB : let's make party first .\nC : then we can discuss we can , then we can have how much for how money is left .\nD : so , this is what design .\nA : so let's , , let's see if it's meet the evaluation criterium .\nD : it's my turn .\nD : let's see if this , if you meet the evaluation criterion .\nD : so , evaluation .\nD : you made very prototype , and , , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that .\nD : so , next slide , .\nD : as , before going and creating and producing these strawberry remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have chance to sell it .\nD : so we need to evaluate it , try to do it in constative way , and as much as we can .\nD : to so what propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven .\nD : one meaning that , ye yes it fulfils the the criterion , whatever it is .\nD : and seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil .\nD : and we're all going to list all the criterion .\nD : i'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven .\nD : and then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our remote control .\nD : so , we can have look at the criteria ?\nD : so these are the criterion i'm were important .\nD : this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote .\nD : so we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle .\nD : so , what do you think , is it fancy ?\nC : what's is really , it's really .\nA : that fancy , we can say it is fancy .\nD : it is very very fancy .\nD : or have you ever seen something like that ?\nA : am not the the only one choosing , .\nD : what do you think ?\nA : what do you think ?\nB : feel the weight .\nD : is it the weight is later .\nD : now we're we're on the fanciness now .\nD : it's quite fancy .\nD : it's , so no it's it's one .\nC : we can give at least five or six , seven .\nA : it's in the other .\nD : one means it's , yes , very fancy and seven mean no .\nD : so it's one or two .\nD : what do you think ?\nA : let's say two , .\nD : so here , two .\nD : then we have technology .\nC : and we have .\nD : so , what about technology ?\nD : we have we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have .\nC : so you change colours .\nA : change colour of , it's .\nD : change colour , that's very quite it's one for that , at least .\nD : at least one , .\nC : still we need to cha , it strawberry .\nD : so let's suppose my daughter take it and and through it away .\nD : do you makes sense that it's going to live again ?\nD : not the prototype .\nD : we just lost one strawberry .\nB : how can say this .\nC : we can easily plug it .\nB : it's still it's still working , and your daughter got bonus .\nD : so it's not so bad .\nD : would say three .\nA : but it's too .\nD : that does make sense , ?\nA : it's robust , .\nD : so the question is does it have the minimum requirement of re remote control ?\nD : these buttons are it not clear .\nA : , lets me try .\nD : but you have at least next produce .\nA : what is next , ?\nC : this is volume control and channel changes .\nD : it depends on the .\nC : these are the main you .\nA : and you can do di two sites ?\nC : and you can do on using these going to scrolling all the option .\nD : so but , , because the is not touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .\nC : so if you don't want , .\nA : you can , by using the you push here the the .\nB : you go you so , the basic mode .\nB : so that's simple .\nB : the basic mode is you got just two buttons and jog dial .\nB : with two buttons , you do this like volume up , volume down .\nD : it's jog dial , .\nB : or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down .\nB : and if you want to make to twenty-five , you push on this .\nC : you can select .\nB : you select twenty , you select five .\nD : it's much longer than that that being two two five , no ?\nD : may not , we can go .\nC : you need to like press two and five and .\nD : that's it's less .\nD : but it's it's , because people anyway don't go there .\nD : but so what do you think for it , usefulness ?\nC : so , , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on .\nD : seems to be useful .\nA : let me understand , because i'm not that's for that this one are two dir directional button .\nD : up down or left .\nA : and which what is that ?\nB : it's jog dial for controlling the cursor on the screen .\nC : this is jog wheel .\nA : it's kind , .\nB : like , selecting the menus .\nC : see in , like you will have blocks and you select which one .\nD : would say then two or three ?\nA : now it's looks us useful .\nD : two or three ?\nD : so size and weight .\nD : is it the the the effective size and weight that the is it real size , real weight ?\nD : or because it size is going to be that , ?\nC : it's size al almost , because it is the weight will be bit lighter .\nD : and and it's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy , for my daughter , .\nC : we will we use titanium .\nB : without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .\nD : not if she can use it .\nC : but sides , the sides should be .\nD : so , should be .\nD : up to three for that , because i'm haven't seen the weight so must not colour and shape .\nD : so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the .\nD : but , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case .\nC : the case is silver titanium , no ?\nD : it's it's going to be titanium .\nA : and what about the strawberries on the top ?\nA : i'm not convince .\nA : but i'm not trendy .\nA : but , , but they're not useful .\nD : it's this fruit and vegetable year .\nD : so , usefulness is as as rem just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness .\nD : whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide .\nC : then it's bit difficult to use .\nD : but this if it's .\nA : would have found more fancy that the fruits are useful .\nD : so , that they will that the fruit may be here instead .\nC : not like this we're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .\nC : so , think we can have rubber or some sponges , for strawberries and different colours .\nC : so it's even these buttons but it looks really not really good .\nD : so , it seems we are not so clear on the shape suggested three .\nA : no , i'm not why if it was like this it's no , it's not fancy any more .\nC : so these are rubber things .\nC : even if you lose one you can just put whatever .\nB : and moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals .\nC : even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and .\nA : and different routes .\nA : see what , so you you you feel like it's something protection for the remote control .\nB : even if it is , , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely completely secure to leave it with children and that .\nC : we've we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just , so even if you don't put , it works .\nC : but this is really fancy .\nD : because , everybody doesn't seem to be convince , although it's quite you have good arguments .\nD : but and the last one is adaptive .\nD : this is not not as important as the other one , but can we adapt it to each each personal use ?\nB : , just look at it .\nB : it's full adaptable .\nA : that's yea , it's fudge titanium .\nB : you can fit it into your palm , .\nD : so you can fit into your palm , .\nD : that what else can we need ?\nD : you do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as ?\nD : it's fudge , , .\nB : it's two point one seven .\nD : fruit titanium , .\nD : if if this is if you are ready to do that , then it deserves one .\nA : let's go for one .\nD : now we have to do the average .\nC : three , three , six , eight , eleven .\nD : who is good in math ?\nD : two point one seven .\nD : two point one seven out of seven .\nD : we have good good thing .\nD : that's all had to say about the evaluation .\nD : so it seems to be good , .\nA : so it's good evaluation .\nC : two one one seven , we have .\nC : so financi energy .\nA : so now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ?\nA : so , have an here .\nD : so so how many batteries do we need ?\nC : we use bat one battery .\nC : we just need one , .\nD : no , ne never install .\nD : two batteries or one ?\nC : no , number is one .\nC : we need only one battery .\nA : but the price is two .\nD : no , no .\nD : but no , no .\nB : no , you just number .\nC : number , number .\nD : no , no way .\nD : you never use excel ?\nA : no , never .\nB : how what what's the limit ?\nB : it's it's that , 'cause it's not my field .\nD : it's twelve bucks .\nD : twelve and half , .\nC : so we we have sample chip .\nB : check that number also .\nD : so it's simple chip ?\nC : like simple chip , .\nD : simple chip , .\nC : four buttons at least .\nC : and then we have the sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .\nA : and for the one also .\nD : one or two ?\nC : one to one .\nD : so the case , which one is it in the end ?\nC : we will go for single curve , no ?\nD : let's do single curve .\nB : it's it's flat .\nD : it's flat , and curved .\nA : you can curve somebody .\nB : but it is flat , you look .\nB : it's curvable , but it's not curved .\nD : there is supplement for that , no ?\nD : it's only curve ?\nA : see , that the the price is this one .\nD : this , you we tried , we tried .\nA : don't chip on me .\nD : so , what is it ?\nA : but she wanted the fudge titanium .\nC : no , only one , no ?\nA : it's five , but you don't say .\nD : let's stick to titan .\nA : again , i'm see it .\nA : special colour , or it's only on the , but there is no colour here .\nC : yes , in display .\nA : so put it here .\nD : so the two .\nA : how many push-button ?\nC : scro , two .\nA : three or two ?\nA : is there the scroll-wheel , .\nD : it's going to be expensive .\nC : one scroll wheel .\nA : that's that's not we choose this one , and not this one .\nD : , no it's , is it scroll wheel and pe push button , this centre one ?\nA : or only scroll-wheel .\nD : or only only scroll wheel , .\nC : only scroll wheel .\nC : so it's already .\nD : you are trying to make make up make us up .\nA : you try to no , no , no .\nA : because how do you do to select ?\nD : no , but you select with the two the other two buttons , no ?\nA : you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you stay longer .\nC : then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes .\nC : and it will activate , plus , , it's price is really special colours , .\nD : it should stay .\nC : buttons and strawberries .\nB : no , buttons just normal .\nA : you you have all of these , no ?\nD : she's very hard on this .\nA : not this one but , so not special colours an interest in ?\nC : we have titan .\nB : that's for buttons .\nB : but buttons are standard .\nD : buttons are the standard buttons .\nD : it's only buttons , these .\nD : so we are at seventeen dot eight .\nD : no , the colour is in the .\nA : and buttons are not colourised ?\nA : they are boo-hoo .\nC : , because you can just go for good colours .\nD : we can just use this red .\nD : it's so what is are we supposed to cut things out now ?\nA : it's already too expensive .\nD : until we get twelve fifty .\nA : so think of what we can cut here .\nD : if look at what is the most expensive things , it's the and the speaker .\nA : we have to choose one or the other .\nB : as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , , producing electricity from mechanical energy .\nB : so , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy to make electricity .\nA : but you don't need battery ?\nB : that you don't need battery .\nB : so , it's something like hand dynamo robot .\nB : real high-tech version of it .\nD : so that would so , but if we select the hand dynamo it's , we only we we win one .\nA : but it's like the hand dynamo , no ?\nC : the jog wheel can be like hand is .\nB : but why not .\nD : that's already that .\nA : it's it's beginning .\nD : let's do that .\nB : let's do that .\nA : so one here and here .\nB : and propose to so , about chips .\nB : advanced chip on print , ?\nB : so , put minus one there , .\nD : i'm not if this is legal .\nA : minus three , no ?\nB : so , was there result ?\nC : no , no .\nC : it's not it's not changing , no ?\nB : let's have look .\nC : it you don't so now on , we can increase our still you have two more .\nD : , , if click somewhere , you'll see features .\nD : yes , it does .\nD : put minus two , so it looks more reasonable .\nD : anyway no , minus two .\nD : nobody will know .\nD : it's not recorded , is it ?\nD : we're on time .\nA : we can put hand dynamo and battery if you want .\nC : we can use it for our party .\nB : and battery and battery , .\nA : both its it's .\nD : no , now we are exp exceeding .\nB : now it's fancy , let's add one instead of two .\nC : that no , but point five point three .\nD : it is it ?\nD : we're exceeding now .\nD : we have to remove the , it's better .\nD : they are counting we would prefer , .\nC : is really strict ?\nA : it's maximum and don't have to , .\nD : maximum is maximum .\nD : so , remove one of them .\nD : we're on target .\nA : so target reached .\nD : i'm just curious to see this my address chip on print .\nD : would say it's the russian trick , but anyway no , they may have some their origins , strange origins no , no , no .\nA : but is english .\nC : and we can discuss all these things in our party .\nB : am not who was programming this calculator , .\nB : 'cause wonder if we put or somewhere instead of number .\nD : let's finish this meeting instead .\nA : save it , so next no , that's yours .\nD : so finance , that's done .\nD : are the cost under twelve ?\nD : project evaluation , good .\nA : so now we have to make .\nD : safe asse safe assessment .\nA : see how are we good team ?\nD : we've listened to everybody .\nD : everybody could say what they thought .\nA : is there enough room for creativity ?\nD : when we see the results , there is no doubt there lack of leadership ?\nD : team-work , very strong , would say .\nC : our team-work is really strong .\nD : team-work , no problem .\nD : whiteboard , digital pens .\nC : we still , .\nB : what was the , what was good ?\nD : white-board is useful .\nB : what was bad ?\nD : digital pens , useful .\nD : new ideas found ?\nA : so , you say , is there sheep ?\nA : so luck , but good .\nA : which imply good team performance .\nD : but , but then mus that's true .\nB : good leader , , good leader is somewhere in the shade and .\nD : and there's one very important point .\nD : we're on time .\nD : meetings finish when they have to or even before .\nC : and we also .\nD : the for meeting it's one of the most important thing .\nB : not to waste time , that's important .\nD : we have other remote controls to create .\nB : we need time new materials .\nC : we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding .\nA : lot of , new ways of doing financial .\nC : new materials , new this fancy strawberry design .\nD : just wondering if my what about the the pink the pinkness of that .\nC : and new tricks .\nA : they're working on pink titanium .\nD : they are working on , good .\nD : there's no no other words for that .\nD : we are probably the best .\nD : real reaction is .\nD : are the costs within the budget ?\nD : is the project evaluated ?\nD : yes , it is .\nC : , it's we got two good score .\nB : so , we see , we can even forecast .\nB : they propose us like celebration , everything , we could forecast it , ?\nD : to the whole our company ?\nA : i'm the one , proposing the celebration .\nA : i'm the program manager .\nB : it was you .\nD : so , let's celebrate .\nD : the meeting the meeting is over at least .\nC : so where we will go now ?\nC : ye will go to italian restaurant , or , .\nD : so , we have to go out .\nC : we can decide .\nA : and we go to the party ."], ["<t> The Project Manager introduced the project to the group. </t>  <t>

television .\nA : and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly .\nA : so people can can use it without any any problem .\nC : we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager .\nB : did you send us an email about this ?\nA : not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ?\nB : we we received an email about this designs .\nD : or you can put it in the shared folder .\nB : you see the email ?\nB : the very no , no the first one .\nD : no , didn't get it .\nB : no , no .\nB : the third one .\nB : you didn't get anything .\nB : got an email about the dis about the discussion .\nA : you get email , .\nB : from the account manager .\nB : you have received the same email , ?\nD : it's for your to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information .\nB : so each of us has role to do .\nD : assign your roles .\nA : for each for each one .\nB : in each we already have our role .\nD : for each person , .\nB : we can so there are three kinds of designs , that's all .\nA : so there are so we have three .\nA : we have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design .\nA : so , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ?\nA : any any volunteer ?\nC : our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager .\nC : no , i'm doing the interface .\nB : i'm doing the interface .\nA : you are doing .\nB : are you using the you are doing the in .\nC : i'm i'm , we have so industrial design .\nC : it was little confusion about my but it's alright .\nA : i'll for industrial design .\nA : and and you norman ?\nA : and and doing the marketing .\nD : i'm into marketing .\nD : nothing much in the project .\nA : nothing related here to the next .\nD : marketing in this design .\nD : design is for industrial design and the user interface .\nB : you see the second mail ?\nB : see there's role for everybody .\nB : even for the marketing .\nD : us user define .\nB : but look at your role , your marketing role .\nD : there's trend watching .\nB : that's your role .\nC : we can have little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the , we want to have new re remote control for for t_v_ distribution .\nA : about the design or we'll discuss this later , no ?\nC : so we have to plan how how it would be developed and how we can make it work .\nD : working remotes we already have .\nD : this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls .\nA : what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics .\nA : and it should not be very costly .\nA : so about the about what ?\nC : that norman and would think about the technical points and we should discuss it in the next meeting , or .\nB : need to collect information .\nB : i'm part of design , perhaps .\nB : what is most important in in remote control ?\nB : what is the most important function aspect ?\nA : you mean the external or of .\nC : you have to make it work .\nC : that's the that's the big thing .\nB : it should be easy to work with .\nC : we can think about an interface with , .\nB : we you can have speech recognition interface .\nB : you just tell the television want which channel .\nB : or or you can say , want to list all the programme tonight .\nA : you won't if we include lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .\nB : instead of remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want .\nB : just say want to press wanna have button for all the movies tonight .\nB : or button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight .\nB : and then you list few , and will choose from the list .\nB : so instead of pressing the channel number , am choosing the programmes directly .\nB : that's one way of making it useful .\nB : no , because no , it's not very lot .\nA : like you you you say we can use speech .\nB : this information exists .\nB : you can get you can use anything .\nB : the the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but and it's more natural .\nC : if you want to choose from list of programme or like that you you may have to to use .\nD : the main function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control .\nA : in the hand .\nD : if we are going to add speech interface , i'm not with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put speech recog if you want to put speech recognition system interface for that the t_v_ itself could have it .\nB : yes , possible .\nD : and could talk to the t_v_ television itself .\nA : except if if you are far from the t_v_ .\nD : need not have an we have some , different technology but , .\nA : this is it's .\nB : but the main idea wanted to wanted to say is that there should be function , instead of choosing the ch t_v_ channel , there's option you can choose , either t_v_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme .\nC : on the content .\nC : it's it's good idea it's good idea but that technically it would be little bit more tricky to to achieve this than just to .\nB : so it's more powerful .\nB : no , because you see now all the t_v_ programmes are available on the webs .\nB : they they are they are they are available in x_m_l_ format or whatever the format .\nB : we don't care .\nB : we just say that this are some content .\nB : we just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes .\nB : some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available .\nB : download it to the to this remote control .\nB : and then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven .\nB : the most there are only seven buttons .\nB : so choose the category one and you reuse the same button , to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons .\nA : we should also optimise the the number of buttons .\nC : that just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so in the dis display on the t_v_ screen and just with the with your remote control would just navigate through the , .\nA : this is good idea .\nB : so you don't have to display here , just display on the t_v_ screen , ?\nB : that will be revol revolutionary .\nB : because all the t_v_ the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end .\nC : so for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this so , norman , draw .\nA : so we have five minutes to you can you can you can use it if you so , can we you it .\nB : we have sometimes to use the white-board .\nD : and another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of so , , if you're watching movie and suddenly there is dark some dark scene , the lights adapt themself .\nD : the lighting in the room changes .\nB : but we are designing just remote control .\nD : we have option in the remote control .\nD : if we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote .\nB : do you want to have conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ?\nA : if if you you you can if you want you can use the .\nB : go on , draw something .\nD : i'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel .\nB : where is it ?\nA : or before the before the the design that says .\nB : where where is it ?\nD : just plug it .\nA : be before before writing you can sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the .\nB : so so the most functional des the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content .\nB : we agree on that , ?\nB : first one is to buttons or it could be anything with buttons .\nB : to choose content or channels .\nB : so we have both .\nB : the user can choose which one they want , ?\nC : by content or by channel , it's good idea .\nB : by content or by channel .\nB : choose by contents or by channels .\nB : so and then what did we say just now ?\nB : other than this .\nC : and we we have to find way how to gather information about the contents .\nB : so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content .\nC : it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's little bit tricky to browse by contents so that's the the things to do and to reflect about it and discuss it in the next meeting .\nB : so these we have to work it out .\nB : so this one of the problem .\nB : and the main thing .\nB : so we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get the funct this is the functional designer ?\nB : that's the first aspect .\nB : we will get information and then we'll come back in .\nA : so we'll meet in five minutes ?\nA : and we'll discuss the other other aspects ."], ["<t> The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements.

second meeting .\nA : for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one .\nA : and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control .\nA : and we have got new project requirement .\nA : so teletext becomes outdated .\nA : so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television .\nA : and we should have our image in the in the design .\nA : so , let's start with the the industrial designer .\nC : so have powerpoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so you can reach it from here .\nA : or you can use the whiteboard if you want .\nD : just go to explorer .\nA : do you want to open .\nB : because it's open you mean .\nC : so will talk about the the working design and and will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television .\nD : slide show , view slide show , .\nC : so can you go one page down , .\nC : so the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve what we want to do .\nC : so i'm thin i'll do survey about what is what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use .\nC : then will try with the technical team to to build prototype and to see with how this little box would look look like .\nC : and how an and we can start troubleshooting first com communication problems or things like that .\nC : and when we are ready with this first prototype we can add some software functionalities on programmable chip like browsing by content or things like that .\nC : so can you go down so , wha what for now is we don't want to have remote control which is wired so we we can use battery for the .\nC : then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication .\nC : and the communication with the t_v_ set is made through infrared communication so this is the the schema of the of the future remote controls so you can you can see the components , battery and the two chips goes to the infrared connection to the t_v_ set .\nB : did you draw it ?\nB : what is the other chip for ?\nB : the one on top .\nC : the one on top is for the the functionali the functionalities and the the red the green one is is to , putting things together , transform the data into qu into the format to to to communicate with the t_v_ set .\nD : one is communication .\nB : to the in .\nC : and , that's it .\nC : we should use f_p_g_a_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to it's field programmable something array .\nB : what is f_p_g_a_ ?\nD : it's field programmable gateway arrays .\nB : so why's it how is it different from the bluetooth ?\nC : f_p_g_a_ is just chip you can you can pr programme it wi with wh whatever you want .\nC : and the bluetooth chip is just responsible to make the communication between the two devices .\nB : so this are the they have to work together ?\nB : do they have to work together or two separate choice .\nC : the f_p_g_a_ will produce the the data to send .\nD : or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ?\nD : and the second one is for the software .\nB : is the is the software par alri .\nD : to run to make it run .\nB : so you can control if you want , ?\nC : alright and that's it for the working design .\nC : so if you have any questions ?\nD : and how about the battery power ?\nD : you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?\nC : no no no no , we have to to have embedded batteries in in the into the .\nD : into the more compact and , .\nC : and don't will need very much power to make it run , so .\nB : you can put it on the charger when you when you don't need to use it .\nC : it's good idea .\nD : having charger rather than putting the battery cells always .\nD : people don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out .\nD : we just make small charger and put it bu our remote , we do not want to make it p_d_a_ .\nB : because you are using because you are using bluetooth , if some people have p_d_a_ they can use their p_d_a_ to control the t_v_ if they want to , ?\nC : that's good idea .\nA : ma we can change the .\nC : also , but but the the goal is to sell our remote control .\nC : so charger for is the .\nB : so is mine .\nA : participant one , no ?\nA : we have so let's move to to user interface design .\nB : so you can open three .\nA : participant during the weekend .\nB : so so i'm working on the technical functions design .\nB : can you show the next slide .\nB : so the the purpose is to to find the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have .\nB : so so found on webs on the internet .\nB : spent lot of time searching and and found that the function of remote control is to send messages to television set .\nD : not the t_v_s .\nB : switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .\nB : so found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you , , .\nA : this are usual functionality .\nB : ours is bit different .\nB : so these are two example .\nB : one is from the other one is from , , engineering centr .\nB : this is the most competing prototypes i've found .\nB : but then loo but then found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons .\nA : and they are small .\nB : on the tried to play with the problem is that if have hundred channels have have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and have to compose the number so it's very lousy .\nB : so you so you move to the next the next one .\nB : so talk about the problem .\nB : and then look at the user manual they are hundred pages thick , so we don't want that .\nB : so propose the easy to use prototype .\nB : you can navigate on t_v_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the t_v_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the t_v_ programmes by x_m_l_ and we need some to do some preprocessing .\nB : from the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the t_v_ set than on the on the remote controller , ?\nB : and then we the speech recognition as harry says we may just put in we may k_i_v_ .\nA : what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the t_v_ than the so we should have specific t_v_ ?\nB : all the processing is done the t_v_ is compu has some processing power the .\nC : so we have to we have to sell t_v_ with the remote control too .\nA : we can use this .\nA : we don't , so .\nB : because are you just wondering what controller .\nA : just the remote control .\nC : there there is there is al there there is technology like show view who is already available on most of the t_v_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because yes , that's good idea , .\nB : so the processing on on the remote controller so it can be used in any t_v_ , any conventional t_v_ sets ?\nB : the next one ?\nB : so come up with simple design , just keep the navigation buttons .\nA : keep the navigation but .\nC : we we don't we we don't need really much buttons to if we have screen to navigate on on the t_v_ so , four five buttons , it's sufficient .\nC : it's easy to build , it does not consume much power .\nD : but you have catch there , assume that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .\nC : then you you go to the main menu and you have go to channel and then you can .\nB : no , because you choose by channel , so you choose by t_v_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from .\nB : if you go by channel , you don't have to do that .\nC : but if you if you want to to make big jump but you you have to to have device when you could you could , not mouse but something that that says more clearly that , left , up , down , , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , directly , or so , we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .\nA : so you are .\nC : but we'll see .\nA : how the this remote ?\nB : it's gonna be small .\nB : so it'll beep if you wanna find it you just shout just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .\nD : too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it .\nB : how bu and responds to you , and i- .\nD : just give it name and we call him .\nC : so next presentation .\nD : after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , most of the points which want to are already covered here .\nD : and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that these are the findings which we got and adding of speech interface is always good for t_v_ remote but the technology we already know that as discussed earlier an it does how feasible it is .\nC : it will be , yes , bit complicated to make speech recognisers runs on the small ts .\nB : but if you to recognise numbers it's well-studied problem .\nB : if you just recognise numbers is limited you have limited vocabulary .\nD : we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .\nD : we just have the it's not going to take much space also .\nC : and this can allow to choose the the program , without adding buttons so it's good idea .\nD : it's going to be very slim .\nD : and next one was the size of the remote control .\nD : it has to be very slim and small one .\nD : and most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , so this is an important criteria here is we have to look for trade-off .\nA : but do you think what they sug suggested possibility .\nD : the features and the cost .\nB : no that if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and comes with reasonable cost .\nB : not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , , extra features .\nD : little bit more if it's with extra features .\nC : speech is important extra feature , , we are we we just have to find mean how to to add microphone or yes microphone into the the remote control , so will be alright .\nA : but is it useful or not .\nA : there is in the .\nD : for lazy they could say nine and the nine channel comes .\nD : or they say movie name or don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .\nD : so , this should be good idea , to put this features .\nD : and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .\nD : as discussed in the earlier meeting , but not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .\nA : if it's necessary can you can do that .\nB : what is the teletext ?\nA : we can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really problem .\nA : what about lighting adaptive options ?\nA : according to the re to the new requirements we don't need that .\nB : it is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller .\nB : so you need special t_v_ sets to do that ?\nB : or it's it's done via this remote controller ?\nB : it's very complex .\nD : it's for the industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not .\nC : it's bit complex too for our next product , our new t_v_ set with automatical sound adjustment light .\nD : as discussed that four points would be good for marketing .\nB : then we can conclude that .\nB : but it's quite possible but not in this project .\nA : so we have we have still we have couple of minutes .\nA : so any things to to discuss ?\nA : or any suggestions ?\nD : the speech interface and less reasonable cost .\nD : and the lighting adaptation and the teletext .\nD : and regarding the teletext these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .\nD : if you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes .\nD : and if you are french guy watching an english movie you would like to have it in french .\nD : and if am german then would like to have the my options in german .\nD : so , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .\nD : that should be good point .\nC : but what about the the new project's requirement ?\nC : we should give up with teletext , no ?\nA : we we can we is the .\nC : so we we can we can already think about way to to access the internet via the television .\nC : because if , but we can think that in few years there will be t_v_ set that can access the internet .\nB : using the t_v_ to access the internet ?\nB : didn't quite understand , .\nC : so it's good idea if if we if if we think about how to to to build up our remote control with this functionality in which will which will come in few years .\nD : we already have some .\nC : so if we already have it in our remote control .\nA : so you have to anticipate the the future ?\nB : the future demand , market demand .\nC : to desi , not not to implement it , but to , to find way to to add to add this functionality in , in an in an easy manner , if is possible .\nB : the functionality in the future .\nB : because all the t_v_ sets will be digital , .\nB : all the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog .\nB : the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change .\nA : so let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after ."], ["<t> The Industrial Designer presented options for each component. </t>  <t> He suggested kinetic energy, a titanium case, and rubber push buttons. </t>  <t> The group will ask if the kinetic energy

conceptual design .\nA : so we will talk about some specific details .\nC : so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two .\nA : this this is what we have decided in the last meeting .\nC : so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control .\nC : so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to to store the energy .\nC : we also we also can put regular battery in the in the remote control .\nC : now by by battery will not have wire between the remote control and the energy source but didn't fou we didn't decide yet which battery we will put inside the the remote .\nA : but if we use battery we will , .\nC : so it's point to discuss .\nC : then the case material we have also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex .\nC : but t's not re real issue for the from the technical point of view .\nC : concerning the interface we can we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .\nC : and this is the last point , the choice of chips .\nC : so what have found is that basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the is the better way to provide energy because solar energy wi won't work in cluttered environment .\nC : so so we can start with these two main things .\nC : for the case that titanium is is good choice because it's trendy and it's it's t's modern and user are are are will be very happy to have remote .\nC : for the interface that we can ach achieve all the desired functionalities by just using rubber buttons , simple buttons and thus this allow to use regular chip that are cheaper .\nC : and so we can move to the next slide .\nB : what is this single curved what does it mean ?\nC : it's it's the the shape of the of the remote .\nB : so it's it's not yo .\nC : you you will have the the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the .\nB : when you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold .\nC : it's more confog comfortable that if these it's completely flat .\nB : and the battery , is it rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?\nC : the that's the point .\nC : the kinetic one is you can recharge by the and by by just by moving the ar your arm the the remote will accumulate energy .\nB : that that's what it means by kinetic .\nC : but it's if it is feasible because if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy .\nB : we we might check with our and d_ department to see if they have this product ready for market .\nC : and and so can you go to the next slide .\nC : so and that's that summarize what have said .\nC : so you're we can see in our and d_ if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .\nB : wha the department .\nB : so keep in touch with the and d_ department .\nC : take care , it's all .\nB : so the titanium case is the normal case that i'll show you some pictures that have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .\nB : 'cause am not very , plastic , titanium or whatever .\nB : there's another point want to make , is that the you've seen them le na my presentation that point out some why buttons are not the not the only ways you can use .\nB : so the user interface is it uses the aspect of computer system , programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data .\nB : so you this gives you the ways to input data and we have we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here .\nB : the idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .\nA : what's the function of this button .\nA : it makes the the interface really graphical user interface .\nB : ea easy to use .\nB : so next one .\nB : so use the button , the mouse .\nA : graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .\nB : so next line .\nB : so the here are some examples .\nB : so they cluster the buttons together .\nB : they group them into col they colour them and they have different forms as .\nB : but this interface are confusing .\nB : there are too many buttons .\nB : so some people are propose voice recognition and so by the way receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you .\nB : so got an email saying that .\nB : and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly .\nB : the next one .\nB : so somebody some people use some people use spinning wheel with the l_c_ display so instead of using the buttons you have screen and then there you can you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as .\nB : touch screen , .\nB : and some people propose scroll button .\nB : integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of just the push button .\nB : like the one we have here .\nB : so so there are few aspects that collected here .\nB : so this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and and prog they are programmable , specially for children .\nB : and then they also secure covers , to protect secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings .\nB : so but we don't have to integrate all these complicated features .\nB : i'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers customisable for different people .\nB : so that's the point .\nB : the next one .\nB : and you see this is the one where you have the protection cover .\nB : useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside .\nB : and for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside .\nB : so the adults might wanna have key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .\nB : the next one .\nB : so this guy this is another company that provides big buttons .\nB : at see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost .\nB : but for our product we don't need big one because you have voice recognition eventually with use .\nB : and you can call your remote controller if you where it is .\nB : t_v_ remote controller where are you ?\nB : and then , he will beeps and to say that am here , .\nB : is it possible ?\nA : we should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?\nC : but as norman say if there is already commercial product available who who do this we we can check to integrate it into our new remote control .\nB : and , this is another one where you can the the the part that's v_ standing for the volume .\nB : so there's up arrow and down arrow .\nB : but you the see that in the v_ , the v_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's v_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so wanna avoid this thing in the design .\nB : and here are is here is short summary that summary that compiled after the findings found .\nB : big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools .\nB : and user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key .\nB : so we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .\nC : you it's it's it's fine you have reviewed all all the possibilities but if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the t_v_ screen don't think we nee we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have or enter key or things like that , because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .\nA : or we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just button like help and you say and you ik you press the button help and you see the the user might in the in the t_v_ .\nC : that's good idea .\nC : to have help button .\nB : so you are display on the screen .\nC : on the t_v_ screen .\nA : on t_v_ t_v_ screen .\nB : so on the t_v_ screen .\nC : on the t_v_ screen the how to use your remote .\nA : so just you push the button and we will .\nB : so that eliminates all the complicated documentation , .\nD : but people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say this is complicated .\nA : if the if no in the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .\nC : in marketing point of view .\nD : and let us see what the market demands .\nD : we could just go to my presentation .\nA : it's just for user customizable , for kids or old people .\nD : it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the same remote with some both .\nA : so so it's the same can be used by both kids and old people .\nB : what propose is that remote controller , it could be cube , is small device that looks like cube and you can just change the the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls .\nA : for kids , kids they like no they like to .\nC : so le le let's see what what people want .\nB : let's see the market demand .\nD : and then we can decide what what we can .\nB : what what market yes yes .\nD : so we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes .\nD : and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires .\nD : we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions .\nD : and we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design .\nD : so seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything .\nD : and eighty percent of the people they are always they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy .\nD : and the current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .\nD : and seventy five percent of the users said they zap lot .\nD : and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times .\nD : so this were the findings which we found .\nD : and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls .\nD : most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the t_v_ .\nD : and by the time they found the remote control the program is finished .\nD : so they're frustrated lot and if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .\nD : so you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex .\nD : so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations this should be the solution for them .\nD : we should have an on the rem remote control .\nC : don't really see the advantage of having on the on the remote control if we have big screen and display on the screen .\nC : it's it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really .\nD : as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .\nD : so if we have on the remote , rather than looking onto the t_v_ you just look into remote and navigate it .\nD : it's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control .\nD : we just play around .\nC : but when you play with the ipod you don't have big screen in front of you , .\nA : you can use this screen instead of the big se screen , instead of use the .\nB : if you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the , after all the just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the , even better .\nD : this were the points which we got from the market demands .\nD : so the other one that's fine .\nC : so we we can focus on the on the fancy look on the on the speech recognition if the technology is available but will will make us spend lot of money for not so big results .\nB : more on fancy design .\nB : remember we have budget for the cost of producing the remote controller .\nD : we have that should be found out by the industrial designers .\nB : so is so the thing is you can find out how much an will cost and then we'll decide again .\nB : you can find out the price and tell us next time .\nC : so price of display .\nD : and it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .\nB : and also the cost for the speech recognition .\nB : ask our and d_ department .\nA : it's for it's just for small vocabulary .\nD : it's only for limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so .\nA : we it's not .\nB : and also the scroller button , how much will it cost .\nC : and compared to the to the simpl simpler simplest button .\nD : the scroll button , from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .\nD : because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button .\nC : that that as we have seen in the in the presentation about fifty percent of the of the percent choose the button so to have five simple button is sufficient for our functionality .\nB : don't use the buttons .\nA : it doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .\nC : but but the the thing is is is that we can add functionality on the on the t_v_ screen like list of function and then you choose with the with the button to you navigate and you .\nA : but they are just less used compar .\nD : they're not used much .\nB : so so the at most more power .\nA : or we can or we can make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .\nC : but if if we if we could have display user interface that is very complete on the t_v_ screen that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left down and enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .\nC : you don't have to to switch to channel to another but but if you look at the you you don't look at the t_v_ screen so it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at , so .\nD : or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have on the remote not on the television .\nD : because when you have the onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands .\nD : so if you have then in the remote , you just have menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the .\nD : and accordingly you can just increase or decrease .\nA : it's and it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use .\nD : that has to be checked out .\nB : that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel , if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for , with the help of speech recogniser you can .\nA : you will listen to peep , special peep .\nD : better if we could just check all the cost with and also with the speech recognition .\nD : and then we could find which would would be more suitable in this case .\nD : and the third problem was to find the remote control .\nD : always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes .\nC : so we we can think about vocal command like find and when the remote control hears fine just to make him beep or .\nD : so , that's exactly what by voice commander .\nD : or it could be also something like this , it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .\nB : put it back at the charge .\nD : and when we're using that remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps , wherever it is .\nC : and that's good idea , that's simple , like in phones .\nD : it doe it also doesn't require voice command , because there are problems with voice command .\nA : but you don't you don't have to move the the charger .\nD : charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged .\nA : you have to keep it .\nC : if there if there there is nuff not enough battery .\nC : also and the remote is lost .\nB : that we can what we can do is we can program function whereby when you press the switch off t_v_ button , the off button , the remote there be instruction on the screen , charge charge me .\nB : you never get it lost because every time you're off the computer the t_v_ you are asked the the command the t_v_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger .\nD : it's an good reminder , .\nB : so you will never get lost .\nA : for some people lazy people .\nB : because everything is programmed inside .\nB : so it's it's it's all about strategy , .\nD : and the final point is fancy look .\nD : as we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by norman they weren't fancy , very big with lot of buttons .\nC : they were ugly .\nC : they the last one with the with the two parts was original , so .\nD : we should have something it you see if it's like that even kid who wants to have control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him .\nB : with two two two parts controller .\nD : but you can have an button for child lock .\nD : so just by pressing the button with some code , you you put lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even .\nC : can think about having on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the t_v_ you can write code or choose category , if it is kids , things like that .\nA : or or you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just just push kids button so it's automatically .\nB : these are probl .\nA : so if he .\nD : these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that these could be included .\nC : so for my part will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use , where to use , and and so on .\nB : we need to define also the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because if you want say we can sort by channels or sort by t_v_ programs , you have to decide category of vocabularies for them .\nB : if numbers , they're easy , but if name the channel by by name .\nC : we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like sports and then on the t_v_ you have list with with with sports program playing now and and , , .\nD : no , we have problem there .\nD : you see if you have voice commands and you are you are watching score on basketball score , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five .\nD : so there should be prefix to some numbers the the you just check all the probability that saying t_v_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five .\nC : but every possible word has probability to come about of the t_v_ so .\nD : ordinary twenty five you almost there's probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and t_v_ twenty five it will be round about one or two percent .\nD : so it's better to have some prefix before the number .\nB : but that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .\nD : something , some code .\nB : you say numbe channel number five of the t_v_ correspond to something else in the channel .\nB : so some people may want to say , want to see this channel .\nD : that will be too big .\nD : and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .\nA : or just it's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel .\nB : check with the and d_ department the capability of recogniser .\nA : it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .\nA : because you have to ch but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .\nB : it's convenient for the user .\nD : als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .\nA : or or the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .\nD : then , the .\nB : that have there's another way you can do is that you can if when the user ch press button to choose the channel , then what you can do is that the you can make the t_v_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button , you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel .\nA : or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .\nB : so you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way .\nA : just you have in the beginning you have you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself .\nC : also also think about another problem , if if there is more than one person who is watching t_v_ the the the speech recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .\nA : by associating each channel with the name or and for each one has his own .\nC : because remember when was young child with my sister we we always want to to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's pr it could be problem if if someone passes by when you are watching t_v_ and say t_v_ thirty and just run , , .\nA : or you have to .\nB : wanna watch this , wanna watch that .\nD : and in the same lines we would have one more problem .\nD : if we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring bad name bad reputation for our company .\nD : so we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or something .\nA : or we can switch on or switch off the the special , .\nD : that should be an option .\nC : that's that's good good option because it's simple and simple to implement also , so .\nD : these are the practical problems .\nD : so we need to take care of them in the design .\nA : we'll discuss them in next meeting .\nA : it's time to close this meeting .\nB : you you stay five minutes .\nD : it came there on three minutes back so we are we can just press the .\nC : so see ya .\nA : for your collaborations .\nD : see you another thirty minutes ."], ["<t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes, one with an LCD screen and one without. </t>  <t> They demonstrated how to navigate through the

design. </t>  <t> Not enough information was given about the agenda of each meeting. </t> ", "A : so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control .\nA : so let's see the what did you prepare .\nB : so can you go out to the shared folder ?\nB : the shared folder .\nA : sh share folder for your presentation ?\nB : we have presentation .\nA : because have here just one .\nB : so got the participant three .\nB : it's the final design , .\nB : so so discussed with guillaume .\nB : and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive .\nB : so we come up with two versions .\nB : one with and one without l_c_d_s .\nB : but both comes with charger and then detachable and or control module .\nB : and detachable big buttons for all people .\nC : so i'll show you the the two prototypes .\nC : here we have the first one with the beautiful display .\nC : you you can here .\nC : and you can just browse into the the navigation menu by joystick joystick-like button .\nC : you can choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like enter function .\nC : you have on the on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here .\nC : and here the the switch that control if you want it's the but .\nA : why you why you you put it in the the side ?\nA : it's not good place .\nB : no it's the all around camer microphone isn't it .\nB : the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .\nD : is it an only single mic or microphone array ?\nC : so it's microphone array .\nA : it's very costly , microphone array .\nC : no it's just single microphone , and you we we put it here because when you when you are browsing your you will be close to t's better to to to place it here than here , .\nC : and here is little switch that control if you want the the speaker recognition system to to be on or off .\nC : and so this remote control comes up with its charger .\nA : how much does it cost this one ?\nC : this this prototype is made for about fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but t's not it's not , but it's just prototype and if we if we optimises the the voila .\nA : it's above it's above the budget .\nD : the cost would be le reduced .\nC : the and the the production costs we we can achieve about ten dollars .\nA : how many battery is there ?\nC : how many , excuse me ?\nC : battery , we use about .\nB : is it the two a_a_s batteries in it .\nB : a_a_ rechargeable batteries .\nC : rechargeable , because we have the charger .\nB : we have the charger so it's no problem .\nC : and you just on one battery .\nA : so one one battery ?\nD : is that two or one ?\nA : it's kinetic reserve .\nB : actually it's flexible thing .\nD : now what is the whole day rating for that ?\nC : the excuse me ?\nD : whole day's rating .\nD : what type of battery ?\nC : it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist .\nD : something like two , three size batteries ?\nC : so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright .\nC : then the next time you pick it , it works .\nB : forgot to tell you there is only single button there , this button .\nC : just explain the button norman .\nB : this button is like the mouse is like joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have click you have double click all in single button .\nB : you can move up , down , left , , or you can do swing .\nB : so swing to the left , swing to the defines other functions .\nB : so even though it's single button , but it is pretty flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement .\nD : and the is this one , on the remote ?\nB : this is the version that comes with .\nB : here present another version without the .\nA : it's not good idea because after one or two months of function is getting destroyed .\nB : this is new prototype .\nC : it's so we have the the second version also with the different button configuration .\nC : the second version is also simpler , we we had just have to put the microphone also .\nC : so it's the same .\nD : and also the switch .\nC : it's the same things as presented before .\nC : but here we have we have four buttons for navigation .\nC : press one button acting as enter button .\nC : so according to what you said it's more robust to the user .\nC : and it's also cheaper to produce .\nC : we can produce such remote control for about four dollars .\nA : no four dollars , it's good .\nD : and you forgot point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's major that's and if you disable speech recognition system then ?\nB : no actually we'll come to that point in our .\nC : it's it's it's embed in the speech recognition system .\nC : so so norman will explain to you .\nB : i'll i'll come to that point later on .\nA : and we will we will serve the charger with this ?\nB : they either these with the the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger .\nA : with the remote control .\nA : so the price of the charger included in the .\nB : it's standard module so you should get it for cheap price .\nB : it's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but again depends on the types .\nB : we have to investigate more on that , but .\nA : the price should be below twelve and half euro .\nB : but as the marketing manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design .\nA : that's so we have we have just the price of selling is twenty five euros .\nD : people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .\nA : and the price of production that's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .\nC : alright go on norman with the special features .\nD : or something like customised .\nB : we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more .\nB : if you want less function if you want reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is modular .\nB : the , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone .\nB : you want microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see .\nB : so it's pretty flexible in the price .\nC : you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control if you if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and which channel you want to choose and so on .\nB : you should present that .\nD : and this is other one ?\nC : here is just the the the module for the kids and if the parents want to watch t_v_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here .\nC : we also have this module for old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works .\nB : the the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful .\nB : simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons but here you only have few buttons but you retain the the same powerful functionalities .\nB : but in addition with simplicity .\nB : so that's the best idea , the cond that that's our an innovation in this design here .\nB : now we come to other important features that did not tell you .\nB : the first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on .\nB : and then we also have security feature this here it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ?\nC : the titanium and so it's very so the price to produce for the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such device .\nB : again and the battery life is is an is an endurable one , again because this is a_a_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .\nB : lithium-ion may be good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then the other points are robust and misplacement reminder .\nB : so when you finish watching your t_v_ and you the you you turn off the t_v_ , and then there's this message coming out that put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part .\nB : and and it also use programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so ?\nB : and then because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also of t_v_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .\nB : so instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the t_v_ contents of the night .\nB : so it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature .\nB : and and for the materials that is cheap to produce it's quite clear from .\nB : and also like the and the fancy designs .\nB : we can improve more on the design but this is the .\nA : what's the price to to produce ?\nC : it's about it the without without the charger it's about two dollars to produce the microphone and speech recognition systems .\nA : with with with the charge ?\nD : with the charger ?\nC : two dollars for the for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger .\nC : so if you sum up everything wi with the , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .\nA : we don't have charger .\nC : it's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about fifteen dollars .\nD : we can use excel .\nA : we don't have all the options .\nA : charger we don't have charger here either .\nA : no it's it's below the the the budget .\nC : but it's just if you want all functionalities .\nA : it's below the bu the budget .\nD : it's input but we have an other inputs from the public demands .\nD : we will just have rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu we can just go to my presentation then .\nD : we can wind up .\nD : or we could come to some final conclusions .\nD : so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and in the market the people are not really interested with , without , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and very handy to hold .\nD : and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .\nD : in that we could put or recognition to be more technologically innovative .\nD : and the third one is easy to use .\nC : that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t_v_ screen with just four buttons .\nD : and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or vegetable , or whatever they like .\nD : so it should be much more customised to make different shapes .\nD : and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .\nB : but the the problem is that is it robust to mishandling ?\nB : we have you should find material that is robust at the same time spongy .\nD : so so finally we have these three criterias .\nD : one is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use .\nD : so these are the three criteria on which we are going to build our remote .\nD : so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .\nD : so now you have with and without , so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven .\nD : so we can make our study on this and no no we have you have designed two products now , one is with and without .\nB : so so is the evaluation depending on us or other users ?\nB : but who will give the scoring we ourself or or third party ?\nD : according to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it with and without ?\nD : let us make this l_ and without .\nD : on on this scale the remote control .\nD : how do you look how does it look ?\nD : is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?\nC : doesn't look much fancy i'll i'll say three or four .\nD : and you both agree for that ?\nB : we can improve on the design .\nB : som someone commented this is like the stone age design .\nC : it's it it technical aspects .\nB : we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .\nB : as for the design we should hire designer to help .\nD : so take three on with ?\nD : so without how would you rate it ?\nC : it's it's more easy to make fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the gives us li more liberty to to have fancy look .\nD : and in the sense of innovativeness , with .\nC : t's it's the same for both so will give five , six .\nD : five with and so without ?\nC : five also norman .\nB : from the innovation aspect feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw in the last meeting is that the retrieval of t_v_ programmes by content , because that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've lot of functionalities .\nC : with lot of functionalities .\nB : so that is that is for both our gi that the our our product is has the best in all this is biased judgement because we designed them .\nD : no no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?\nB : the innovation is is very high .\nC : for both it's the the same innovations .\nB : it's the same innovation .\nB : so put six to seven .\nC : six , let's go for six .\nD : no actually to make it with you make more efforts .\nD : so there is high innovativeness included if you make it with then when it is without there is not much innovativeness .\nD : so we can't go that what you are sayin that's what the design no it's like this , on the , according to what understand from your model is , you have joystick here , and you have , you just press your joystick , you get here programme .\nB : there there was there was issue here is that what are what is the display on the ?\nB : we haven't really determined what are actually actually it's good to have but what are we gonna display on ?\nC : talk about but you have the same programme on the t_v_ screen .\nA : so let's remove it .\nB : but yes exactly .\nD : then no on the t_v_ you don't it doesn't display on the t_v_ now .\nA : but this is the problem .\nC : if you have the , but if .\nD : then there is no meaning in having it on the t_v_ .\nD : or then again you have channels , volume and all the and what that depends upon your design , so so without you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?\nB : but you cannot display all on .\nB : anyway for for the users who who who opt for we'll give them the give them the , we give what the customer wants , .\nD : and which do you recommend easy to use , with or without ?\nC : both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and the menu are clear , well-organised , so with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so will give six for the easy to use .\nA : no it's just if see the the the rate it's better to do it without .\nA : because that's with just will increase the price , and thi they have the same rate so without it will be .\nD : or we can just go back to the previous slide where we ha we have few updates .\nD : so in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or spongy touch without and without speech recognition .\nD : even then our product is going to be very good .\nC : it's cheaper to produce .\nC : and if the the we have less technology we have more liberty to for the shape and things like that so .\nB : have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect .\nB : the easy to use aspect is different for different people .\nB : for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because they they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons .\nB : for kids they want simply the similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why we have the parental module .\nB : we can ha have build more complex design if if they want it , but but what i'm trying to say here is that the we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people .\nB : so in terms of easy to use it's very user customisable .\nB : user customisation is very important .\nB : so it's the same .\nD : so without take it five ?\nD : or you want it to be six ?\nC : yes as you say , with better .\nD : it's better to have this without .\nC : and to improve the the look .\nD : as our programme manager pro project manager says that without it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use .\nC : yes and to give us more liberty to have fancy look so so let's go back to our laboratory and .\nA : what what what about the sys speech recognition ?\nB : to improve on the design .\nA : what about the integration of speech recognition ?\nB : the speech recogniser is add-on module .\nD : that's going to be an optional .\nD : if somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .\nA : so it's optional with the .\nD : it's an optional .\nC : it's optional , since according to this study people more likes more to have spongy remote control than .\nA : it will be it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because parents will lose these .\nD : but if you have an add-ons , the kids may just hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it .\nA : or parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same .\nD : in the same set , , and and individual buttons to make them work .\nB : the problem is if we are bla if customer wants certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them .\nB : so we might lose the customer because of this .\nB : what do you think ?\nA : so you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional will be optional .\nB : yes exa what do you think , .\nB : you are marketing manag .\nD : how to how to how to make marketing survey that how many married couple or how many couples have t_v_ or to the number or singles who have television .\nA : it inc increase .\nD : so based on that but you can make it on single p_c_ with three different options .\nB : but the the question is does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ?\nC : t's about the same because if you can if you had something li no , because if you if you add something because it's three different pieces to to to build but it's it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities on the same module , but .\nD : on the same p_c_b_ .\nB : ll the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .\nB : so so so if don't don't buy now they can buy in the future .\nD : you could just provide with an optional .\nB : so in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again .\nD : so it's something like microsoft product update .\nB : we're not trying to follow the microsoft and we don't want to the the buyers can be up the would be can be upgraded , it would be good thing ?\nA : and and we we we we we we don't want that .\nD : updates and we sell it .\nD : we make updates and sell it .\nB : it depends on the production .\nD : and what's the idea about the shape of the remote controls ?\nD : can they be made into fruit and vegetable types ?\nC : so we are but we are also the the components will have to change because we have to deal with the shape and but don't will increase the cost too much so but it's bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to we can have the same global shape and then add on skins and with with this tex spongy texture things like that .\nD : do you require different types of p_c_b_s and or it could be like this the p_c_b_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior shape is different for all .\nB : what we can change is to propose the customers with skins .\nB : the the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that have new skin and looks better .\nB : you can pl in what material would that be in ?\nD : you need to look into the material .\nB : or furry like pet dog thing .\nA : so project evaluation project satisfaction , .\nC : so we finished the prototype presentation if you have something else to say .\nD : the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .\nA : we have to ask these question .\nA : we have to give answers so project evaluation .\nB : suppose that you this criteria , is it ?\nB : room for creativity .\nB : this room is bit small , but but it's for us to work with .\nD : feel it's fine , we know we don't need it's .\nC : that was good .\nD : this is fine for making presentat for project presentations .\nB : anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's .\nD : and the leadership was excellent .\nB : good job good job .\nA : he gave you the liberty to talk as you wants .\nA : the teamwork was very very good .\nA : was really am very satisfying to work with with you .\nD : and new ideas found .\nD : any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ?\nC : come up with new product .\nD : what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ?\nB : we know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings .\nC : and also more more it's it's good idea to have clear clear points whenever we do meeting prior to the meeting to have list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but it's alright .\nC : we achieved project goal .\nD : that is within the budget .\nA : de without without , without speech recognition , it will be simple .\nC : it's yes , more or less .\nD : and the evaluation was .\nD : and the next is celebration .\nD : so , very much .\nC : so coffee machine .\nA : free free coffee .\nB : alright then , we finished ?"], ["<t> The project manager acquainted the team with the tools and equipment around them and then had the team members introduce themselves by name and what role they had in the

: i'd like to welcome you to our first meeting .\nA : i've prepared little presentation .\nA : my name is and hope you will introduce yourself in few minutes , as will .\nA : i'm the project manager of this project , and , will tell you on what actually is the project .\nA : this is the agenda for our first meeting .\nA : this is the opening , then we will get will hope we will get acquainted to each other .\nA : we'll do little tool training with these two things .\nA : we'll take look at the project plan .\nA : there will be time for discussion .\nA : actually we have to discuss because we have to create product .\nA : and then we will close this session .\nA : but first of all we i'd like to introduce you to this room .\nA : as you probably have noticed there are little black fields on the table .\nA : you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face .\nA : there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face , , and this isn't pie , it's set of microphones and there are microphones here also .\nA : but don't be afraid of them .\nA : they won't hurt you .\nB : ll i'm and my function is user interface design , .\nA : said i'm the project manager and i'm hoping for good project and i'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project .\nA : let's start with the ladies .\nB : so that's me .\nC : i'm i'm the industrial designer and hope to look forward to very pleasing end of this project .\nD : i'm marketing expert .\nD : my job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers .\nD : so also hope we have pleasant working with with each other .\nA : have some expertise from different pieces of the of the company .\nA : said we're working on project and the aim for the project is to to create to design new remote control which has to be original , trendy and , user friendly .\nA : and hope we have the expertise to create such project such product .\nA : the way we hope to achieve that is the following methods .\nA : it consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .\nA : as you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and meeting where we will discuss our work so far .\nA : but first will tell you something about the tools we have here .\nA : already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of much use to us .\nA : we will have to take advantage of these two things .\nA : they are smart boards .\nA : as you can see , you can give presentation on them .\nA : and this one here is white board .\nA : will instruct you about that soon .\nA : as you also noticed this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is it is possible to show that here in our meeting room .\nA : and there are available on both smart boards but we will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder .\nA : as you can see , this is the same tool bar as is located here .\nA : the most functions we will use will be to to add new page , to go back and forward between pages , and to save it every now and then .\nA : and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , like this if everything's , but first have to put it on the pen , you see i'm new to it too .\nA : and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .\nA : as you can see you have to move it little bit slow , it's not such fast board , it's smart board but also slow board .\nA : but you can write things and you can also , when you click here , erase things , so we have est left .\nA : and you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that .\nA : just simply create new one and start all over because we want to save all the results .\nA : does everyone understand this application ?\nB : so we can't erase anything .\nA : you can erase it with the eraser , but you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create new blank one .\nA : will delete this one now because we don't use it yet .\nA : but you can erase when you make mistake , but don't delete entire pages .\nA : and you can also let's see it's here change the colour of your pen , take blue one and change the line width like to five .\nA : that's what you will need for our first exercise , because i'm going to ask you to draw your favourite animal .\nA : it's also to gets to know each other because i'm asking three things , for that drawing , to do it on blank sheet , with different colours and showed you how to pick colour , and also with different pen widths which also showed you .\nA : and favourite characteristic can be just one word .\nA : 'm not very good at drawing , but will go first and try to draw or you should what i'm drawing , .\nC : seal , seal .\nA : could be everything .\nC : with tail and mouth .\nA : when put on this thing it could be turtle , or snail , and but turtle has .\nB : it has wings ?\nB : the snail doesn't have legs .\nA : and those are slow .\nA : and hope our project group will not be slow , but we will work to good result and do it as fast as we can .\nA : time for another animal .\nA : would you like to go next ?\nD : it was four months ?\nD : to make it little bit easier .\nC : make that cute .\nD : no , it's giraffe .\nD : it's easy to to recognise as giraffe .\nD : the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything .\nD : and hope also reach lot with this project .\nD : so that's my favourite animal .\nD : anything else you need to know ?\nA : could you write the words , underneath it ?\nA : or more words .\nB : so draw , but .\nB : you can what it is , hope .\nB : and it's quick , .\nB : that's my favourite animal .\nA : and our final drawing .\nC : draw i've drawn dolphin because of its intelligence .\nC : one of the most intelligent animals in our world .\nC : i've i've eraser .\nB : you can try out the eraser now .\nC : not perfect , but .\nA : see we have some drawing talent in this group , ?\nA : animals , words .\nA : back to business , back to the money part .\nA : from the finance department have learned that we are aiming for selling price of twenty five euros .\nA : and we're hoping for aim of fifty million euros and we are hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market .\nA : and the production cost will be twelve euro fifty max .\nA : t's time for some discussion .\nA : i've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about .\nA : what's your experience with remote controls , what ideas do you have to design new remote control , for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments .\nA : actually i'd like to hand the word back to you .\nA : what's your experience with remote control ?\nC : lot of buttons .\nB : always lose them .\nC : and you always lose them .\nC : lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use complex .\nC : not user friendly .\nB : search for the buttons , which one is which and .\nA : boring , it's not fun to use remote .\nD : black , all black .\nA : we should try to make it fun .\nC : they use batteries and batteries and poor signal .\nD : the the angle you have to use .\nB : perhaps that you have lot of road remotes road con remote controls .\nD : you had different remote controls for different devices .\nC : different remote controls , .\nB : yes , perhaps you can integrate them .\nC : for the use of different devices .\nB : your stereo and your t_v_ and .\nB : perhaps that's an idea .\nD : but then again you you still have lot of buttons , so flap .\nC : but you could thin there's possibility to to to put those buttons behind some protection so that if you only get to see them when you need .\nB : and which you don't use .\nD : , that's possible , but it'll get very big the the remote control .\nC : that's possible , so that you only get the no no , just you got the same size remote control you use everyday , but the usual buttons such as zapping as you call it in dutch .\nB : you should just give it to .\nC : and the volume control are only the only possible buttons to use directly .\nC : or the numbers , .\nC : but not the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television .\nD : on and off .\nC : you only use those the first time , or .\nD : play , pause , stop .\nA : so minimalist design , the least possible amount of buttons .\nB : but you should make that you have every button they need on it .\nB : because things for teletext , , what's the name ?\nA : so you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat .\nB : but but if if it's if it's international you should look in britain they have different things they can do with the t_v_ , or so that you can choose what you want to see .\nD : because market will be all people .\nD : elderly el elderly , young people , so .\nB : if you should take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal t_v_s that and the b_b_c_ .\nD : that's the better one , because if you you're going to target lot of people and the whole world and only britain then the cost will rise higher than the twelve fifty , .\nB : if the they have that anywhere else , though .\nD : the aim is better to use the whole world and britain , .\nB : we can leave that .\nC : when of it the main idea of this remote remote control is to make it user friendly .\nD : not that much .\nC : so when when the customers will buy this remote control , they already have the remote control which companies with the the standards remote control with which comes with the television .\nC : so it only has to have the most used buttons .\nC : you don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television .\nC : in those in that but but it is impossible to to accommodate accommodate all the buttons on the on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control .\nB : but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search .\nD : it it's that's not , .\nB : that's not , .\nC : because sony television has the opportunity to to make to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen teletext , and on the other side just regular television .\nC : but they don't use the same signal , on remote control .\nD : most televisions nowadays do this .\nC : because you can't use panasonic remote control on on philips television .\nD : but then you have to choose the this always with universal remotes you have to choose the code .\nB : you can choose the code .\nD : you can use which which type of television you have .\nD : that's no problem .\nD : but like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , .\nC : but that most people will buy the remote control because because the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken , so perhaps they have got an older television , so that option is not optional for those people .\nB : but the people have new television , and if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke .\nC : so we should take that in consideration .\nA : any more ideas ?\nC : things'll come up .\nA : we have some time .\nA : let's see what more have to tell you .\nA : don't think there is much left .\nA : we're starting to close .\nA : our next meeting will start 're little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes .\nA : in the meantime there's time for some individual actions .\nA : as you can see , the different roles have different tasks .\nA : and there's ping .\nA : is it my laptop ?\nC : stop the meeting now .\nA : that's good , five minutes and the meeting's over , on schedule .\nB : meeting will close in five minutes .\nA : the marketing expert will will take look at the user requirement specification .\nA : the user interface designer will work out the technical functions design .\nA : and this was the interface designer ?\nA : or the interaction designer .\nA : or what was it , i_d_ ?\nA : interface designer , , first was .\nA : will take look at the the working design .\nC : no , the industrial designer will take look at the working design , and the in usability interaction , .\nA : industrial designer , , .\nA : let's just use the acronyms .\nB : so so should look at what you should be able to do with the remote , or , or how don't really .\nA : and specific instructions will be sent to you through your personal coach .\nA : those instructions will be in the email you will receive shortly , hope .\nA : and you have your own expertise .\nA : that was what had to say .\nA : are there any more questions ?\nA : then we have to head back to our offices and start working .\nD : have one question .\nD : where does it says we have to make remote , because presumed she didn't know who .\nD : no , no problem .\nA : we're still going .\nA : expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive shortly .\nA : see you all in about thirty minutes , then ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and then the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote

.\nA : let's see what we can find here .\nA : very warm welcome again to everyone .\nA : here we are already at our functional design meeting .\nA : and this is what we are going to do .\nA : the opening , which we are doing now , and the special note , i'm project manager but on the meetings i'm also the secretary , which means will make minutes as did of the previous meeting .\nA : and also put these as fast as possible in the project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed .\nA : if i'm , there are three presentations , each one of you has prepared one ?\nA : and we will also take look at new project requirements , if you haven't heard about them yet .\nA : and then we have to take decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes .\nA : but we will need it .\nA : who wants to go first with his presentation .\nC : i'll go first .\nC : i'll go first .\nA : you can go first , .\nD : shall go first with the users ?\nB : everybody already has his presentation , so you can adjust it .\nA : is there an order ?\nA : haven't and one question , your name denni , is it with i_e_ e_i_e_ , .\nD : ja precies , ja precies , ja precies e_i_e_ .\nC : , wanted to explain the working design of the remote control .\nC : it's possibly very handy if you want to design one of those .\nC : so it works as wrote down in this little summary .\nC : when you press button , that's when you do pr when you want to turn up the volume , little connection is made the the rubber button just presses on on little print plate which makes connection that gives the chips , which is mounted beneath those that plastic of rubber button .\nC : senses that connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau the the volume up or volume down button .\nC : the the chip makes morse code like signal which then is si signalled to several transistors which makes which sends the signal to little let .\nC : what let is ?\nC : and that makes the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set .\nC : which has sensor in it to sense the signal of the infra-red .\nC : that's how it works .\nC : the findings that found searching up some detailed information about the remote controls , are that they are very easy to produce , it is pis it's possible to make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as printing page , just fibreglass plate is is covered with some coatings and and chips .\nC : and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls have to work or how that how to make some chips that are possible to to to transmit those signals .\nC : made little animation of about how tran our remote controller works .\nC : we tel there .\nB : there is something turning .\nA : it's little bug it's in the in the smart board .\nC : the sub-component , suppose that you understand what sub-component is , is in this example it's the button .\nC : when it is pressed down , , the switch is ter is is switched on , so with the wire is sent to the to the chip in co-operation with the battery , because to make signal possible you have to have some li ad electronic yes , , .\nC : after it's being composed by the chip the signal is transported to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals morse code-like signal to the to the to the bulb in in the television set .\nC : wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control .\nC : it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to wind it up , or just is it's it's very light to to make to use it .\nC : personally pref prefer that it would be come available in the various colours , and easy to use buttons .\nC : but suppose that the one of the other team members thought of that too .\nB : i've got it there too .\nC : and it is possible for several designs and easy to use , easy to use buttons .\nC : perhaps soft touch , touch screen buttons because the rubber buttons are always they slightly they can be slightly damaged , so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore .\nC : and as said before we can make several designs .\nC : , that's my contribution to this meeting , and two of these this meeting .\nD : to this meeting .\nB : shall go next ?\nB : my name's , and looked at technical functions design of the remote .\nB : did this by looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they they look , and information from the web that found .\nB : what found was that the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you what you described just early .\nB : and this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , change the channel , adjust volume , that thing .\nB : play video , teletext , but also play c_d_ if you use it your c_d_ player the remote control will that one .\nB : there are some examples of remote controls .\nB : you can see they are very different .\nB : the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of buttons etcetera .\nB : and the other is more user friendly , little with big buttons .\nB : and not all the the the the you can do with it , but the the essential is there .\nB : you could better you should look at user centred approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't t's usable they won't buy it .\nB : lot of buttons they may think from don't need as much as that .\nB : perf personal preferences is is simple remote , with the basic functions that you can need that you could use .\nB : but keep in mind the new functions of t_v_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and is that function that you should have ?\nB : because all the t_v_s will have them .\nB : or because of only few and isn't really necessary .\nB : and then make it would make so that you can could use it on more than one appliance .\nB : if you have one that does with the vi the the video , it could also work with with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that thing .\nB : the shu you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have lot of buttons for anything .\nB : and it should be user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much .\nB : and that is my presentation .\nB : you must still have it open .\nD : kijke , so .\nD : we're going to discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that that means that functions user want to have on the remote control , or just , and the users , actually .\nD : the methods prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus on more .\nD : are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ?\nD : and then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section .\nD : younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five years are more interested in fj features like screens , speech recognition etcetera .\nD : and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age .\nD : the elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area .\nD : fifty percent of the users lose their remote often .\nD : so we don't have to make it very small , like like mobile phone , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore .\nD : seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use .\nD : important issues about the remote .\nD : it would be better with personal reference , but .\nD : remote control has to have to have low power usage , because seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with high power usage we would use lot of but batteries .\nD : the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to be find very easily .\nD : and have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera .\nD : it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone .\nD : my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be senden .\nD : so if that's if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote .\nD : like wh colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized .\nD : or should be covered , or in screen .\nD : screen is easy because we have the screen , we have the various options .\nD : put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone .\nD : and you don't see the buttons .\nD : so screens should be easy , but an screen , the problem with the l_ sc screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the screen lot .\nD : so we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use .\nC : screen as in touch screen ?\nD : touch screen , .\nD : the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features .\nD : because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people .\nD : and the older people spend more money , and easily on remote control .\nD : so we have to keep in mind to to focus not lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people .\nD : and on my personal preferences , don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like said , screen is easily to use because you have you can implement lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons .\nD : and it should be easy to use .\nD : especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels .\nD : and that is it .\nA : did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements ?\nA : then it's good thing that made separate slide of them so you can all read them .\nB : res did not .\nB : perhaps the rest ?\nD : ja , be television .\nA : not in this presentation .\nA : should be in there .\nA : tell you them from my laptop .\nA : teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet .\nA : so that's the first thing we we should pay less attention to teletext .\nA : the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and would make it more costly , .\nA : our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before .\nA : and last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .\nA : so we have to keep that in mind .\nA : according to our agenda it's then time to take decision on the remote control functions .\nA : so , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ?\nB : you said it should only work with one appliance ?\nB : or with one che only the t_v_ ?\nA : only be used for television .\nB : and the video also , or not ?\nD : only the television .\nA : says only for television here , .\nA : makes it lot easier , ?\nD : so , then you can .\nD : requirements , no ?\nB : then it should have on , off , and .\nC : for standby options , ?\nD : the basics then by volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , teletext doesn't have to be ?\nB : and per perhaps no .\nB : yes yes sh button where you can change from one number to two numbers .\nC : two two two digits , .\nB : can you if that's got name , but .\nC : understand what you mean .\nD : it's it's easy to implement button with what which especially do that , because some t_v_s , if you press the one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's that's not relaxed to user .\nC : it makes it twelve , .\nC : not really and and there are some models that don't accommodate that function .\nC : so wh the philip's television makes it possible in that to press one and then two to make the tj to reach channel twelve .\nD : so that it easy and fast .\nC : but all the television makes use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to to get , .\nB : so you should have that one on .\nD : our main targets' age are ?\nD : forty five plus , or ?\nB : mute misschien also .\nA : new product should reach market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers of forty plus .\nD : forties , because because younger people as younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are eighty one percent interested in screen .\nD : from twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so to because on most recog remote controls the print plate will be broken how much , two years .\nD : you have to press very hard to go to the next channel .\nD : with the screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to for fingerprint , and then you can use it again .\nC : we we could .\nC : but that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap .\nC : because screens are very expensive .\nD : but you true .\nC : touch screen probably even more .\nB : an but , do you but if you would do an screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ?\nC : so , true , true .\nC : but is it possible to make an screen , how was the information ?\nD : it only says that this perce percentage like screen .\nD : because , and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical .\nC : so perhaps we should we should focus on that screen .\nD : and if the only , because our target is sixteen to forty five .\nC : but will we not exceed our our production is it possible to find out , anyway ?\nD : you how much it costs .\nD : you how much it costs , the screen .\nD : no , don't have any costs here , only have percentages .\nB : or because if it only directs at the t_v_ , then you only have what you want to do with the screen .\nC : no , an screen's just like like drawn here .\nC : just displays several buttons , if you wanted the minimal use buttons , such as channel and volume , you just displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to press them down , just like touch screen .\nB : so you can , .\nB : so you can adjust which buttons you want on that screen .\nD : if you want to adjust , like , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone .\nC : we can make it possible to do that , .\nA : so we're going for an screen ?\nD : it's the most easier thing , .\nA : and hoping that when we produce lot it won't be too expensive .\nB : had twelve fifty , , for production ?\nB : how expensive an screen is .\nC : suppose wi if the mar if our if the if the young people are interested in screens , we should make .\nC : and if that is our market share to and our goal to deliver those remote controls .\nB : but but he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an screen ?\nD : but , forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent .\nD : but our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .\nB : so still little bit people .\nB : but you don't want to alienate the other but if they also buy it then it's alright .\nD : no , that not now , but , so , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger .\nA : so it is ?\nA : and what else ?\nC : hope we and let's hope to reach those those sales .\nD : if it , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then , we should be sticking to rubber buttons .\nC : can you that that they will send you some information about the cost of screens .\nD : nothing , no costs .\nC : so if you , so if you you receive an email about that , can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in our projects mail folder .\nB : but perhaps later , so .\nD : in that should we all get the costs of everything .\nB : don't perhaps we should have backup plan that we would use buttons if it's too expensive .\nC : because you are the the marketing expert .\nD : , i'll i'll post it .\nA : but for now it's .\nD : then you have the seventy five percent of users find it ugly .\nD : and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with when remote would look fancy .\nB : that's bit of problem .\nB : that's bit of problem .\nD : tha it'll look fancy with screen .\nC : it's looks fancy one , of screen .\nB : but they don't they don't like it .\nB : they t's ugly .\nB : when it has an screen .\nD : just the plain remotes , not not specific remotes .\nB : alright , that you said that .\nA : and you can make something fancy out of an remote , because it's new , as far as know .\nD : and then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap lot , but that's not question with the screen .\nC : and then not .\nD : only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .\nA : what else does our remote need ?\nD : the most important things on on an on an remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power power usage .\nD : and teletext , but that is not of the question .\nB : but but shouldn't you put button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ?\nD : other things are ?\nD : it could be .\nB : remembering we have got big remote that you have to fill .\nA : and we could make an separate menu on the screen for teletext .\nC : and there's also sh but in sub sub-menu like that .\nD : and other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , but less important .\nB : they are less important , but they should be there , or not ?\nD : should be there , but not press , sub-menu , .\nC : it's also important to make it possible to how do you call it in english , , to not use batteries , and use ac bat batteries to to be .\nB : like with with mouse , you have not , .\nC : so you can mount the the the the remote control to to refill the .\nD : in breath it's charted .\nB : we should think of the twelve fifty we have but how much that's going to .\nD : but we don't we don't have any costs now , so .\nC : because when you get an screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be empty very soon , very fast .\nD : power supply is one of the most important things .\nB : you should perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off .\nB : if you have an screen that's burns all the time .\nB : you shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can .\nC : and go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that , automatically .\nD : it's it's not that easy because don't think people will like it who who that you have to turn it on first and then use it , so it's better when the t_v_ shuts down , the remote shuts down .\nB : nee that's that's .\nB : but then you can't .\nB : au automac matically , that it .\nC : after two minutes or three minutes , something like that .\nD : after two minutes , two three minutes , .\nA : and low battery indicator ?\nA : on the screen .\nD : and then that before an hour when its get again gets empty .\nD : then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in recharger .\nA : so we are going for the for the recharger .\nB : if it's sensible .\nD : because when you're watching t_v_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in recharger , and don't , , but then we have to be that the the the the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then .\nB : when the batteries are low but you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember .\nC : no , when you when you're done with watching your television , you have to put it , .\nD : then you have problem .\nC : but but you also forget to buy batteries , and then you can you can't use it , so .\nD : or we have to be that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged .\nB : the batteries should should should work lot longer than couple of days , or not ?\nD : because you have but you have screen .\nB : 'cause , , but .\nD : high power usage .\nC : high power user cell , it should be standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also advantage because you can't lose it anymore .\nC : because you are obliged to put it in the charger and not to leave it in couch between some cushions .\nD : you made point there .\nB : but then you also have to have somewhere where you can put remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk long way when you twoft want to turn on the t_v_ .\nD : otherwise all your .\nD : just small device .\nC : it hasn't it doesn't have to be big .\nD : plug it in , that's it .\nB : everything has it for and .\nD : like like telephone charger .\nC : just just cable , or even charger where you can mount it on .\nC : something like that , just .\nA : 've , you have some more points .\nD : it has to be easy to use also , or things .\nD : market share , speaker re speech recognition .\nC : functional designs for the elderly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not display button at ten points , or but it is one of the functions you have to specify .\nD : that this should be standard .\nD : large button large buttons .\nC : because we can look at perhaps forty buttons at screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons .\nA : and you said something about speech recognition ?\nD : it says also .\nC : twelve euro twelve euro fifty .\nB : twelve fifty , twelve fifty .\nD : that's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .\nB : so it's pretty big .\nC : spread it by big market .\nA : even bigger than for .\nB : know let's do speech .\nC : let's leave out all the remote controls and just put microphone on top of the television to .\nB : you can clap .\nC : turn volume up .\nC : that that's an idea .\nB : now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , .\nC : that should it has to be remote control , not .\nB : but they want to talk into the remo remote control , , or ?\nC : why not why not , .\nD : is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in remote control .\nD : it's the only thing it says .\nB : but do we want to implement that , or ?\nD : an screen should be suf sufficient .\nA : but when you look at the percentages speech recognition scores even higher , ?\nD : it says lot , but no it's better to have l_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want screen and thirty five want speech recognition .\nC : perhaps the options should be why not ?\nA : , because of the cost , but nobody knows how much it will cost .\nC : let's hope to have some we should do it .\nD : so it's better to keep it with screen .\nA : but would it be useful to imple implement both ?\nD : if the costs al allow it .\nA : on one remote ?\nB : if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty .\nB : with that , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ?\nD : if it should be done , if it could be done , won't matter .\nC : certain systems already exist , .\nB : then you also have to have different languages if we go international .\nB : then it's it's yours to do french and dutch and english and , .\nD : but that should also be with should be also with screen .\nC : this should be accommodated with some software , , .\nD : because then in chinese is different written , volume is different written than swahili .\nB : you can use icons for the speaker and but if that's better than language for the for the remote .\nD : ja , possible .\nC : so we want to it's international .\nA : so , no speech recognition ?\nA : or , and then we have different languages .\nB : if it could be done , we .\nD : we have to keep .\nC : it should be done .\nC : if it could be done , should be done .\nB : that should be anything matters .\nC : that's not so difficult , because already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to not all , but , , .\nA : just make separate remote for each , so we only do this when we have enough money left .\nB : you sh you should to adjust the thing .\nD : every language of dialects it's very differen difficult .\nB : and you have to speak the so that it can understand .\nD : it can't be implemented , but , 's an option , yes .\nB : you could use that as an option , if you have money left , .\nD : fifty euro cents .\nB : let's do speech .\nC : for speech recognition .\nA : 've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , the digits from one to zero , .\nA : or from zero to nine .\nA : digits button to switch between one and two digits , mute button , separate menu for teletext , battery indicator .\nA : we're going to use docking station and probably and if there's enough money , speech recognition .\nA : and the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons in general .\nB : with teletext if it wasn't ver very important , it was but you also now have colours .\nD : no , but curved ?\nB : if we should implement that .\nB : when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the if we should implement that , because it says that teletext not really important , but , the shortcut , and you can't go to sport .\nD : we should we could that we could also implement audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus .\nD : mainly if you turn the remote control on , you have to you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume .\nD : and if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it .\nC : sh , just just sub-menu .\nD : it should be available but not not .\nB : 'cause it should be there .\nC : not directly available .\nA : so not too much teletext support , but in separate menu , and , but no more buttons or functions , or ?\nB : so actually it is there but it's just not ready there .\nC : so does it confuse the user ?\nB : you'll have to search for it .\nD : they'd have to be easy to use .\nC : if you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options become available .\nD : the sign of it .\nD : what else can you do with television ?\nB : we've got anon have got got two examples here , but don't think there's anything we're missing .\nA : aren't we forgetting something very important ?\nD : play , pause , doesn't need to be there .\nB : we don't have the video orders , you could look here all the the , technical functions .\nD : yes , so this is your presentation .\nD : we could check the other remote controls with technical functions .\nD : which ones were yours ?\nD : techni ja ja ja ja ja .\nB : they're bit small , you can we should stretch them , because we've got them all .\nD : go to have volume , mute but .\nD : the zoom buttons .\nB : and for t_v_ ?\nD : wide screen , high screen , different things you have , different .\nB : can you zoom in t_v_ ?\nB : or that you can put on on on wide and .\nB : but that should also be sub then , sub menu thing .\nD : it should be available , but then in separate screen settings .\nB : so we should also implement se screen settings .\nD : screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have .\nB : so you can program the , so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can go to .\nD : so those four , and the main .\nD : like tap screens or , .\nB : hope we can do this .\nD : something , if no , you don't yu no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it .\nC : there are lot of options depending on what television you got .\nC : 'cause if you don't got wide screen television you don't need the the screen settings for and if the television does not support such operations .\nB : we don't have to use that top .\nD : so you leave it alone .\nD : or it could be possible to have standard version of the remote , an expanded version .\nB : and do we want them in different colours , or and and the buttons , should they have colours ?\nC : colours the main colour of the remote control is the colour of the screen .\nB : but we don't have any buttons .\nC : because we don't want lot devi device self , so use very lot of peo adjust with phones , yes .\nD : then defines itself .\nD : because how many percent ?\nB : they t's ugly , ?\nD : would spend more money if it looks fancy .\nB : perhaps you can make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones .\nB : you can but don't think that .\nC : twelve euro fifty .\nC : make it available in different colours , you mean ?\nC : red , white , blue , black .\nA : and see-through , that's the signal for las final five minutes .\nC : sea view , yes , simpson's versions and leave .\nD : see through version .\nD : if you press button , it turns green .\nA : so have the things read .\nA : then we have separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ?\nB : so you can program the t_v_ .\nB : perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile .\nB : so , options , and then you sub them .\nB : otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , but , but .\nD : could be possible .\nD : or like you have menu button , you press , or otherwise you have menu button , press menu then you have main menu search all the all the settings .\nA : no , we said teletext also separate menu .\nA : but we can work that out later , .\nA : so we're having general menu with the most used functions , teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and there are options for the remote itself ?\nA : like large icons or small icons and what else , but , but on the , ?\nD : because we don't have lot of buttons on the one screen , the buttons , but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button .\nB : or do we have any buttons ?\nB : on the remote .\nD : those buttons you can you can .\nB : but that's also in the , ?\nD : no , no normal buttons , .\nB : so we don't have any normal buttons that no , alright .\nD : only the on and on and off button .\nB : yet on and off is is perhaps you kno no , no .\nA : but we don't need special we don't need special options menu for the remote itself .\nC : not button , you need settings button , or settings option for the remote control .\nD : but don't think , no .\nB : you should be able to set which t_v_ you have .\nB : if you have if you have .\nB : but isn't idea to use what you said , normal on and off button for the t_v_ , that you don't have to use but but not for the remote but for the t_v_ , that you use but not as normal button , in the , .\nD : no no no , because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically .\nD : but t_v_ , that's the that's best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel .\nA : there should be separate button apart from the , because you can't turn it on when the is off .\nA : so how do you turn the thing on ?\nA : there has to be on button on the remote , ?\nB : no you just tap .\nC : just tap it .\nD : touch screen , then it's turn turn off , turn on .\nA : tap the thing .\nA : and then the television is on also , or just the remote ?\nD : no , just the remote .\nD : television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then t_v_ should be available .\nC : it should be in standby mode , but normal button on the remote control , or norm ?\nB : whether it's handy to have normal on button , just rubber for for t_v_ , so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel .\nB : otherwise you whether or not that's , .\nB : to turn it on .\nB : of or you should put it in the screen .\nC : because when you touch the screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .\nC : wh why would it be need to have normal button ?\nB : if you use the screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you you you then turn it , and then the t_v_ goes on .\nB : but if you have normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want .\nD : but the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of also the on and off button .\nC : it looks lot more fancy if you use if you don't have any buttons on the on on remote control .\nA : so actually we're going to create button-less remote .\nA : that's might be unique selling point , for remote .\nB : if we can afford it .\nA : we have to postpone further discussion to our next meeting , because we're running out of time .\nD : if we can afford it .\nA : for now , we're having lunch break , and then there will be half an hour for the next share of individual work .\nA : will

an agenda the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side .\nA : we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened .\nA : once again will try to write some minutes which from the previous meeting placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing .\nA : today we once again have three presentations , if i'm , and after that we will take decision on the remote control concepts .\nA : and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that .\nA : 'd say let's start with the first presentation .\nA : in the same order as last time ?\nA : take it away .\nC : welcome you all .\nC : components design , first of all would like to accommodate some of those things elaborate some of the things did .\nC : elaborated on the concept .\nC : what should be said about the components , its properties and what materials should we use to to make one of those remote controls .\nC : first of all i've subtracted some of the components that is that are used are from what the remote control's formed .\nC : first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control .\nC : would like to give you an idea of how about .\nD : don't destroy my giraffe .\nC : giraffe's gone now .\nC : the case was is made from rubber , suppose .\nC : there's one of the because when you use remote control lot of people will will drop their remote control and they break becau the titanium was also an option .\nC : but it's very expensive material .\nC : rubber is , , the best suitable material to use for our for our remote control .\nC : it's poss it's also possible to create fancy colours with rubber .\nC : rubber makes it easy to to to it lets lets itself colour .\nC : titanium you have to paint it and with that it's possible to scratch it or make it ugly .\nC : rubber the total piece of rubber that's sor that's that's used to make the case is the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps it's little bit damaged .\nC : but it's very strong material .\nC : had an idea single covered curved , , single curved .\nC : so it's two dimensional .\nC : it's it's best to draw green .\nD : you have to go it's side view .\nC : let's make it black .\nC : of an idea like this .\nC : so it also looks when it's on your table .\nC : so you get it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's it's stands .\nC : side view yes it's side view so i'm not technically good at three d_ modelling , but .\nC : it's just an idea had so it's it's very so its also looks when it's on the table .\nC : the graphical user interface and the buttons , we also thought about that already .\nC : about the touch screen , which is is easy to clean too .\nC : one of the advantages of the screen you just use some or another cleaning cl some cleaning .\nC : and it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright .\nC : already explained some properties of that material and also we almost concluded about that this should be our button component .\nC : so that's all about the buttons .\nC : the batteries , we also thought about that already , will be chargeable with an option for mount station so you can put the the remote control in mount station so its charges itself up instead of plugging it in like that .\nD : no no no no no .\nC : and they should be long lasting , not not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use .\nC : and next step is the chip the component that's makes or transmits the signal to the television .\nC : there was an option to use rather simple chip but because of our highly requiring requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition which unfortunately is still in test phase , so there should be some more investigation on that side .\nC : my personal preferences also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use our own business colours .\nC : that was correct , wasn't it ?\nC : they are rather boring for for use with rubber .\nA : business colours it was the the slogan and the corporate image , so , it needs colour , but don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .\nC : they should be sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ?\nC : so it it doesn't says to have the slogan ?\nA : it must be recognisable .\nC : we could make little and on the top of the machine .\nB : you can put the and .\nC : so they are pretty boring , suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very fancy remote controls which peopl who people in which people will find they're interesting .\nC : and will buy them faster when they look at the same old grey or black colours .\nC : as said before rubber is is impossible to damage severely imp instead of you can break it when you you when you break it in with pair of scissors like that , but if you drop it it's not broken away instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium .\nC : and personally liked the single curved remote control , because it it makes sense .\nC : that's all about my my findings .\nB : will go next .\nB : alright so little bit about the interface .\nB : how it should look .\nB : and we determined that will not be no buttons , but only an screen , so had to look on that .\nB : and the design is therefore based on what we just thought of .\nB : first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition .\nB : and this is that you you ask you give question through through the device and it answers you .\nB : and they already put this in an in coffee maker .\nB : and so that it you say good morning , coffee maker , and it says says to you back good morning joe or what's your name .\nB : this and there's an easy way to program that you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer .\nB : perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people lose the remote , they can yell remote where are you and calls .\nB : and perhaps we could implement that .\nB : and then have to go out of the presentation because tried to make some idea of how it should look like but 't draw , so don't make too much of it .\nB : tried to the screen tried to to draw .\nB : at least the icon for the volume .\nB : if there is an icon for the program , but .\nC : not just p_ .\nD : p_ , just p_ .\nB : so and then the buttons above and below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .\nD : where's where's the button for two ?\nB : forgot that one .\nB : forgot something , but .\nB : and and the numbers , that should be bit larger it's not really on scale and and .\nB : an options button .\nB : and the the button for teletext apar apart because it's not really options , .\nB : it's options is the settings of the remote and of the t_v_ and that thing .\nB : so could call it settings .\nB : but this is bit how it .\nB : and the somewhere on the remote .\nB : perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand .\nB : but and and microph microphone for the speech recognition if we want to implement that .\nB : and then if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this .\nB : and it's also think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings .\nB : and older people also don't really want to use this this option menus .\nB : so they want to use one button and then something happens , and not choose with this and you could put in an really little scrolling device on the side of your remote , so you could scroll scroll across these things .\nB : that's an option .\nB : and that was my finding dinge .\nA : now our third team member with his presentation .\nC : go danny , go danny .\nD : i'm going to tell you something about trend watching .\nD : the trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and .\nD : the method used was like told watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted from elderly and young people .\nD : so we can keep that in mind for designing the device itself .\nD : the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy .\nD : the second important thing that should be if inv in innov innovative , , like the screen that's quite innovative so that should be meeting for this .\nD : and the third thing is it should be easy to use .\nD : with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use .\nD : the personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like banana yellow , strawberry red and .\nD : the round shapes , and soft material materials like the rubber .\nD : it should be soft it should feeling spongy or sponge bob like things .\nB : let's build it into sponge .\nD : elderly people like au colours which are being seen in autumn like woods dark brown , red , deep reds and .\nD : they liked square shapes with round edges .\nD : and hard materials like wood , titanium .\nD : they those materials they liked .\nD : this is bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that .\nD : and then personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like this .\nA : so for the older people , more traditional form .\nD : it's it's bit like banana .\nD : and the colour should be yellow , .\nD : and for the elderly people just plain old .\nD : because we decided to have two remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ?\nB : it was one remote , , different colours .\nD : different colours , .\nD : we should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes .\nD : like my colleague , you said , is that's better , or for the elderly people something like like the ipod , with round squares .\nD : simple but easy to use .\nD : so that's it .\nD : that is my , like the older older colours .\nB : you could you could change the colours , that was also the idea .\nB : which shape you should should take , but .\nD : colours the elderly people look something like that .\nA : changing colours will be easier than changing the shape of it .\nC : changing just the shape of the remote control ?\nB : perhaps you could find something in the middle .\nC : round corners , but but square , .\nB : round but square .\nA : but then both groups won't buy it .\nB : if you do it square , with round corners but little in the middle of it do what ?\nC : you mean , like .\nB : like like this bit .\nB : so it's bit square , but it's also bit round .\nC : kinda like beer glass .\nB : so but then same sides .\nC : it's also easy to to have to to put in your hand .\nB : but that's but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's but perhaps that's good thing , so that's easy to use .\nB : people know the .\nC : will recognise that's as remote control .\nC : when saw your .\nD : autumn colours like red , brown .\nD : they liked the wood lot .\nD : so we could give it like wooden loo look look in that colour .\nC : kinda like old cars , let's put it all together .\nD : and bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval things .\nD : those , those things .\nD : so you see the big difference between the young people ?\nD : fresh , exciting .\nD : and the old people , old and boring .\nB : but that's easily to do with the colour , .\nB : that's easy to do with the colours , .\nD : it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape .\nD : because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than the shapes .\nD : in material rubber , rubber is , like said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood .\nD : so we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber .\nB : think also in between .\nD : something between that .\nD : soft rubber which you can you can feel in it .\nB : don't think you should be able to mould it , but .\nD : or or wh what's something harder .\nC : it should shouldn't be .\nD : no no no but but you have to like like like eraser .\nD : that's the bit you can press it in , harder .\nB : bit like this rubber .\nB : this but it's quite hard , this .\nD : something like this , .\nD : it's quite hard but you can press it in .\nD : it's feels kind spongy .\nB : don't t's rubber .\nD : are you going to invite sponge bob , he can that's the better thing to do .\nA : so we need spongy feeling .\nB : did you have something about so we should first decide about shape , .\nB : which then you can fit the screen in it , and can decide .\nC : also can't help but notice that you used an you had remote control and the screen was rather small .\nD : that screen should be like three quarter of the of the the buttons won't get that small when the screen is .\nB : it it's supposed to be bit bit bit .\nC : this was your size , but it should be larger .\nC : so so you don't have to put your .\nC : new , blank .\nC : so when you get this kinda like this .\nC : or should it be larger ?\nC : because you want to put your hands you want .\nB : but if you pu now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen .\nD : becau because you have , true , true , true true .\nB : perhaps that's best .\nC : your thumb here .\nB : but not on the screen because that's that's an idea .\nB : looks bit like game boy now .\nC : because when you put your but if yo if you make the the screen as large as the remote control itself , you'll you'll always get some you .\nB : you always touch it , .\nC : going to be very greasy and .\nD : but it won't get that small because you have how much ?\nD : nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .\nD : one to zero , the two digit , you have to you have to because some fat people with thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .\nC : you don't want it too small .\nC : how how large they have thick fingers .\nC : but if you wanna make it in international , japanese people got rather small hands and we got these large zoom opt , .\nD : true , but , we have we have the zoom option , ?\nC : you can make it larger to to to with accompanying greater fields to push the button .\nA : and we won't include pen , to point , , we we want to do it with our fingers , ?\nC : your fingers , .\nC : you don't want because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't use you can do whatever any cloth .\nB : you could include pen .\nD : use pen you you you can lose the pen .\nA : but people want to use remote with with their fingers because they're used to that and and we have to add tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , .\nD : the fingers , .\nB : if they t's handy to use pen .\nB : this this is good size for the screen .\nB : how how large the actual remote should be but little bit like this , .\nD : but that that can be with plain soft tissue .\nD : you can buy those at it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station .\nA : if interrupt you , should should show some points on which we should take decision .\nA : so we can discuss these points .\nA : those points energy question mark .\nA : how how should we supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it .\nA : chip on print and case .\nA : those are points my coach advised me to discuss here , but hope you have ideas about them .\nB : energy were batteries and then and .\nC : the docking station .\nA : so that's the the the first point .\nA : we already decided that on the previous meeting .\nD : so if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can change them .\nB : just like with the telephone .\nC : kinda like your you got some some of those wireless mice ?\nC : kinda like those batteries .\nB : but it should be normal batteries , not not like two or two .\nD : normal plain you no normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop .\nA : simple rechargeable batteries .\nB : what was with the chip on print ?\nC : the chip on print ?\nC : chip on print with with simple sim not simple but we also discussed that .\nA : but how did this how does that with screen ?\nA : you still have print plate .\nC : beg your pardon ?\nD : you always have print plate .\nD : you always have print plate , ?\nD : always , so what what we have to decide about that .\nA : t's good question .\nA : it just was in there and didn't have any information about it , but .\nC : chip on print , what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got , it's always clear for the remote control when you press certain button .\nC : but when you got screen , with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place , if you enlarge button , or if you got several options appearing on your screen , the co-ordinations aren't always the same .\nD : but , but the print plate of l_ screen is more advanced than normal print plate , so that that's not of any discussion , .\nC : when you got regular button , the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the .\nA : you need some c_p_u_ , .\nD : don't don't think that's but if nor it's quite simple .\nC : it is simple c_p_u_ but it doesn't because it has to but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume .\nD : it's quite simple screen .\nD : they don't need that big of c_p_u_ .\nD : , true true .\nC : so it has to have some calculation unit or c_p_u_ to know in which state you are and which button you are pressing in at the moment .\nA : because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the screen .\nC : and touch screen makes it possible to to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen .\nC : and the case , we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber and hard rubber .\nB : but but hard rubber like this ?\nB : or softer rubber or .\nC : that's the easy to ha to to .\nB : it bounces back from the floor where you throw it .\nD : we have different colours .\nB : this in different colours ?\nD : so the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and round shapes ?\nC : it's our main target .\nD : no don't think , it's more round than square .\nB : but it should be bit longer , perhaps .\nD : so it meets it meets more the young people than the older people .\nA : but that's what we want , .\nD : that's our target .\nD : lower than forty years , it was .\nC : and how about my idea of making it with one single curve ?\nD : that that that was quite good .\nC : so because it's gadget and you want to show it off , .\nA : you have fancy design , then , away .\nD : you can put it on your table with the screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and .\nA : so so but wrote it down .\nB : that's good idea .\nC : it's lot easier .\nD : so you can't you you can't , you you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the and load it on the the user the server .\nC : so , so you got did you write that down ?\nB : and then , you can it's pretty easy but and , had what should again .\nC : got single curved rubber fancy coloured remote control .\nA : what about the user interface , there are also some some questions about the concepts you have some ideas on that .\nA : you you showed your drawing .\nB : miss few buttons , but .\nB : at least what we should also have on , remembered , menu to go back through the first if if you touch options , you can't go back to this away now .\nD : you have to go back .\nD : isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?\nD : with the minus and the plus .\nD : it's easier than .\nB : it was easier to handle this way , but what they think .\nB : would you like the the buttons horizontal or vertical ?\nD : for sound and channel .\nC : depends on the screen .\nB : we make it like this , if you put it like this .\nC : if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter .\nC : if you make it in rectangle so it's it's it's it's square .\nD : it's it's easier to have it something like button minus here , plus over here .\nD : minus here , plus over here .\nD : and on here .\nD : the other buttons and on here the top .\nD : the options and then you have something like the p_ over here , and the sound .\nB : but wou that's matter of what you're used to .\nD : something something like sh plus minus plus minus .\nB : would put plus and min here .\nB : and then the p_ in the mid in the middle and the sound in the middle .\nC : take your time .\nB : but when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus .\nD : you're going to you're going to use it with one thumb .\nB : perhaps have some examples .\nC : we'll leave that to the usability engineering then .\nD : who's the usability engineering ?\nB : but i'm going to look if i've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used .\nB : the 'cause they can use that better .\nD : have that those numbers .\nB : here is our here are don't really know .\nD : or good watch .\nA : everybody's searching in his data .\nD : per hour one hundred and sixty eight .\nD : volume selection four times an hour , that depends on on on the remote .\nB : but but if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on normal remote .\nC : so not how much not how often it's used , but .\nB : what's what's usual or normal .\nB : yes i'm looking here .\nB : but here's it's below , here also , and now here's here's next to each other .\nD : because have two televisions at home .\nD : one is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends .\nC : it does it doesn't really matter , but .\nB : the the the volume was usually above each other , because you go higher and down .\nB : and the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back .\nB : that's how it's is usually when look here that's what see .\nC : let's cut to the chase .\nD : it's got to change .\nA : we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the concepts .\nD : is it is user interface .\nB : this concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place and the speech shall we implement that ?\nA : we just heard about the new technology , ?\nD : it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says i'm here .\nC : makes it possible to .\nB : but then you should also find place you could if you do it like this you could put it in corner .\nB : you can talk into the corner .\nC : not even necessary , because lotta you can make very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to just put it arou underneath it or on the on the bottom of the remote .\nA : at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also microphone over there .\nB : but , that's also .\nB : so , in the middle .\nC : but that's not import that's not im very important because , it doesn't matter where the microphone is .\nB : but you should decide where you want to put it .\nC : , , tha underneath ?\nD : where it isn't seen the most .\nC : it shouldn't be very visible .\nB : you could you could put it in logo of the company .\nC : why no but it doesn't makes it any more fancy because you get to see .\nA : just in the the spot you just pointed out because it should be in in an important position where people can see it , because it is the the unique idea of our remote , , the the speech control .\nD : between the round of the .\nB : so where do you want to put it ?\nA : where the one hand but are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ?\nB : actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it .\nD : bu but the left under corner should be the best .\nB : it's way for you to so it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that .\nB : about microphone , there is no button .\nA : because microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote .\nD : where isn't it isn't most in sight .\nC : put it there .\nC : that doesn't doesn't really matter .\nA : so type , supplements , anything .\nA : already discussed that , , the the and .\nC : the , supplements the supplement is to .\nD : the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy .\nD : it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen .\nD : if you want to go back you have to back button go back , if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that sub-menu .\nB : the the young people do like scroll .\nC : use the scroll .\nD : you do like it ?\nC : so why not , on on side .\nB : or at least if it's really the scroll , but the menu they like most , and you can never get through menu with scroll but you have it's we have five or four .\nD : it is is faster .\nC : so if you've got settings , if you yes .\nD : becau the scroll's easier if you have lot of options , but if you don't have lot of option then .\nC : you have lot of options , because when you use you get when you use the settings menu to look up some some channels on your on your television , you should scroll scroll down on menu which probably does not fit on your screen .\nC : so then it's very handy to to scroll down , you make just rubber just like on your mouse or .\nC : just put it on the side and it's very easy to use .\nA : and would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and .\nB : it's also different .\nA : there's our five minutes warning .\nA : any more questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ?\nD : no , colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear .\nA : everybody think they can can work for that ?\nC : what's the standard colour ?\nD : and standard , we don't no we have different colour .\nA : is there standard colour ?\nC : you got you got different colours , but you should have standard colour .\nD : how many colours are we going to black .\nB : you should you should have black one because black is standard .\nD : black is is the standard .\nC : with the with the yellow just regular remote colour .\nB : but if you want to be different , then silver .\nD : dark grey , something like this this colour .\nC : and then have different covers to use .\nD : or or silver .\nD : it's better to have silver nowadays .\nD : you see more silver than black .\nC : you see lot of silver televisions .\nA : but still silver and black are silver is new but also traditional , so what about yellow thing , it could be ugly , but it's definitely fancy .\nD : the the silver black are our main colours .\nD : we have silver , black and between those is like five colours between them .\nC : it's better to .\nD : it'll be banana yellow , we have .\nD : green , wood , brown .\nC : but if you use silver , rubber silver rubber isn't fancy .\nC : when you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy .\nC : silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine .\nC : especially when it's made of soft rubber like this .\nA : would think about colours like red , yellow , green , blue , just .\nD : the fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown .\nB : just all colour .\nA : so who's pinging ?\nB : and and do we have to have normal black one , or is it .\nA : you are pingin .\nA : we , so that wraps it up ?\nA : everybody knows what to do ?\nA : wrote it down here .\nC : not what to do .\nB : what to do , but .\nA : wrote it down here what to do .\nC : not what to do .\nA : the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes .\nA : here are the individual actions , and especially notice that the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on prototype drawing on smart board , and to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach .\nD : we'll be available .\nB : but do we have to we'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we .\nA : i'd say just for email and find out .\nC : thin we should work .\nA : that was what had to say , , final thoughts from anyone , or ?\nB : so we have to keep talking english now ?"], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer

created separate folders because it was tending to get little busy in our shared project documents folder .\nA : if everybody put their own documents in the folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting .\nD : that's new one ?\nB : we didn't make any in didn't we just do that ?\nC : we should save that one .\nA : then i'll move this one .\nC : save in the folder .\nC : save as project .\nA : no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is .\nA : and we have evaluation left here .\nA : not main documents this time .\nA : have it open myself .\nA : the detailed design meeting ?\nA : we're finally getting somewhere hopefully .\nA : what are we going to do ?\nA : i've opened it already .\nA : i'm still going to take some minutes , and if i'm , you two are going to give prototype presentation ?\nA : yes , you are .\nA : and did you do something with evaluation criteria ?\nA : and we have correct agenda .\nA : and then we have to look at something which is less , the finance aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those .\nA : finance will be later .\nA : now i'd like to give the word to you two .\nC : get up stand up .\nB : we made prototype .\nB : we first start with the overall this is about the total remote control .\nB : we made it green .\nC : just example colour , so there's one of the colours we would like to see in our prototype .\nB : it's fresh colour .\nB : and the screen light blue .\nB : this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under .\nB : and the and logo , it just says and now , but any questions so far ?\nC : just just an idea about how to that could also be possible .\nD : that's the place where it's going to be , not the size .\nC : it's an idea in so .\nB : you perhaps you should make it bit big , so people t's there and .\nC : do not forget it .\nC : to function it it doesn't really have to be sm big .\nC : the microphone could be just minor hole on the left button .\nC : we also made some ideas about how the options menu would work .\nC : using the scroll button on sides , you push the scroll button and drop down menu or pull out menu comes out and you get you get the options becoming available .\nB : you push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's remote settings , et cetera .\nC : t_v_ settings , remote settings , et cetera .\nC : so you can scroll down too with the scroll button , as you can see , it's here , just push it in , the menu comes out like this and it all becomes visible .\nB : and you could also touch it so that it comes out , and and use the the the scroll thing as with your fingers .\nC : it's also to see that we made small menu , the options menu becoming available when pressing the scroll button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used which should still be used and we think that it's very handy to put it not under the options menu , but in yes .\nC : in an apart in separate button , .\nA : so separate button for for text , .\nB : perhaps we should use the teletext sign in .\nC : sign , , just like , .\nC : we can modify that later .\nC : would you like to make any comments about next previous page , , .\nB : this is the total interface that of the screen .\nB : the numbers , which is pretty straight forward .\nB : we put ano an an extra button in .\nB : we can erase it , but it's the button where you can switch channels .\nB : just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button .\nB : that one , .\nB : it has name .\nB : and we put that in , it would be handy there .\nB : this the one number or two numbers button .\nB : below that , the page and the sound .\nB : and in the middle the the mute .\nB : it's it's bit big .\nC : it's quite large .\nB : and this is the the on off knop , the stand by knop .\nB : or at least it should look like it .\nB : and the options of teletext .\nC : you can see very clearly now that the teletext and options menu isn't taking much it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very when you when you use it , doesn't become irritating to see .\nC : 'cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu .\nC : 'cause people regularly read from left top to down , so .\nB : this about it , .\nB : will put it back on the on the green .\nA : and missed when was typing the r_r_ stands for ?\nB : that's the logo of the .\nB : it's now it's only , but .\nA : would have recognised it if it were the colours .\nA : the evaluation criteria , ?\nB : full screen , .\nD : my task was this time to put up questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users .\nD : my name , my job , .\nC : my name , my job .\nD : questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps .\nD : one means not true , seven means true .\nD : the three important things of refa are from of this year is are , is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use .\nC : you used the powerpoint what ?\nD : and then evaluation itself .\nD : is the design fancy enough ?\nD : project manager , what do you think ?\nA : t's looks fancy , especially with the green colour .\nD : but does it .\nA : and the the curves which we decided , ?\nA : only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ?\nC : now the single curved idea was , , you ge .\nB : it it's in the background .\nB : you should make sideways view .\nC : the sideways view , that that that ma ho not that pen .\nB : it will be , .\nB : we can would smart board .\nC : not that pen .\nA : might work one time , .\nB : can draw here or .\nD : , you can .\nC : my , it works .\nB : so it would be something like this from the side , but with bit of curve here , ?\nC : that's the single curve .\nB : so if you flip it like this .\nC : that's not very it's also very handy if you make side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom at bottom at bottom .\nC : make it rather thick on the top , because on the top it has the screen , which takes in some space , and the batteries can be located over there , so .\nB : so you just make the back of this part bit bigger , so that it lays bit , that's bit of problem .\nD : isn't going to be little bit heavy at the top ?\nD : with two batteries , the whole print plate and and top , and if you're holding it quite lot .\nB : the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , so if you could .\nB : 'cause otherwise it does .\nA : but we have to rate these things now ?\nD : we have to rate .\nD : is it fancy enough ?\nD : true is one , false is seven .\nD : so fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people .\nD : have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that that much now , it's only design .\nB : if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it .\nC : it's pretty fancy .\nD : and the design .\nA : especially because of the microphone and the screen also .\nB : whether older people will use it , but would make it two .\nA : very new thing .\nA : fancy the old people will .\nC : it's true , it's one .\nB : alright , it's one .\nA : no , it's two .\nA : little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , ?\nD : used wouldn should use that one , but it doesn't , no it's two ?\nB : but it's one .\nD : true is one .\nD : very true , is it very true or isn't that true ?\nA : 'd say two on scale no , , that's true .\nB : they t's very true , but , but we should perhaps that not .\nC : it's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , so it's very fancy , .\nC : have you ever seen remote control like this ?\nC : no , , so so it's fancy .\nD : that's fancy enough .\nA : that doesn't matter that much , so make it one .\nD : let's give it two .\nD : is it innovative ?\nB : it is , because it has an screen , mi microphone .\nA : and you use these buttons the most , ?\nC : and the scroll is rubber , so eno enough to .\nD : we have for the search function .\nB : it's from rubber .\nD : the scroller bit it's it's one .\nD : also the buttons , are they easy to find ?\nD : that was big requirement of the old people .\nB : because they're on your screen .\nB : so you can use the the the arrows .\nB : they're on your screen , so where you'd search .\nC : with the ones .\nD : are all the buttons easy to find ?\nD : not only this buttons , all the buttons .\nB : the options are it little bit harder , but if you touch the options then it's no they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find .\nC : take harder look , , .\nD : it's easy , this is easy now .\nC : it's easier than the regular remote control .\nD : the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to to handle .\nA : so so which so which number are we going to fill in ?\nD : would rate it , , that's true , that's true .\nC : they are lot easier to find than than on the regular remote controls where you have to find out what which sign or icon means on every button .\nC : so you have you have to use the the the manual to understand most .\nD : but that's that's vantage of screen , you can have text .\nC : it's it's two , at least .\nB : you can make it two .\nA : two , three and what do you think ?\nC : it's not perfect , but three ?\nA : so we have two , two , three .\nC : and why is that ?\nD : personally think , because don't it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find away .\nD : if you have the button at the , don't think you can find the option button that easy .\nB : but you don't have have to use the button on the .\nD : you can touch it .\nB : you can touch it .\nC : it said bo both the options .\nB : you you can touch options .\nD : , but you have then you have here written option on here , the teletext button , ?\nD : then , good .\nD : then also two , .\nB : you can touch options and it's comes out .\nA : two , , because we have to it's the box below it , ?\nC : two , two .\nB : the the below .\nC : the next question the next question .\nA : otherwise we have two results in one question .\nD : it's easy to use , as for younger as elderl elderly people .\nB : for young people it's easy to use .\nD : young means sixteen to forty years .\nD : and elderly from forty eight to their death .\nB : it's in the entire mankind .\nC : it's the most useful remote control ever to be manufactured .\nA : you're very enthusiastic about your own design , ?\nD : also if you're sixty years old also , as as your if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand no , but we're going to make this for all people , so it it it has to be if you read the manual , always .\nC : but because it has the regular controls , li as you can see in the screen now , and you don't have all the other options always on your screen .\nC : so it's it's really easy to use .\nC : you want these options to .\nA : as for the for the older people ?\nB : but , but they they don't want the extra options , ?\nB : so , , but so they could it is .\nA : and would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?\nB : if they read manual .\nA : because that might .\nA : that's the most user friendly and easy to use .\nC : perhaps that is one of the most because lot of channel one , channel four , .\nB : because it it's not it's not it's it's not difficult .\nB : you say you say record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer .\nB : and that's everything it does , the speech recognition .\nA : that would make it even more easy to use for them .\nB : it would make it would make it two .\nD : so also two ?\nC : because all the people who can't two .\nD : not seven for this ?\nA : i'd say three .\nD : would also say three .\nA : so we have three three two two or so what are we going to do ?\nB : two and half .\nA : three , see .\nC : give me more .\nD : remotes overwhelmed with buttons .\nD : no , that that's that's .\nB : but , that's definitely one .\nD : tha that's one , , that's definitely one .\nC : that's definitely our false , .\nB : nee , seven is it ?\nB : the remote score .\nA : but you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't calculate anything from the results , so , one , because we designed for that , ?\nD : isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed .\nB : it's not overwhelmed .\nD : remote control has colours that different that meet different target groups .\nB : 'cause we make them in different colours , so that they .\nA : and though we had about single colours , but you can also make wood colour , not just one single colour but wood-like thing , can't you ?\nB : that it that it looks like wood , like something , .\nD : also with rubber ?\nA : whether it looks like wood , it isn't it isn't wood but you can make print on rubber , can't you ?\nB : it it feels like rubber , but but then when you scratch it it does come off .\nA : so that's one then , ?\nC : it is it is harder to to like geez .\nB : so that's bit we have time .\nA : do you have many questions ?\nD : have the material used is spongy , that that's that's one , that's rubber .\nA : , but we have we also we have to get to the money .\nC : we're getting paid .\nC : we're getting paid .\nB : , it's very spongy .\nD : t's not the most spongy thing .\nB : but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber .\nC : it's three , because you want to make it rather flexible but not too flexible , because it has screen .\nB : you can break it .\nD : remote control is hard to lose .\nC : hard to lose , it sh and it's easy to find .\nB : you could you could call it .\nD : you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old .\nD : if first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it .\nB : you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose .\nD : it isn't hard , no .\nD : this is two , personally .\nB : that it's hard to lose ?\nB : it it is there's the it's six , you think ?\nC : isn't hard to lose .\nA : so isn't hard to lose you .\nC : isn't hard to lose , .\nD : isn't hard to lose .\nB : so it's two .\nB : you can lose it , so don't you can make it three it does have an built in function .\nD : you can't lose it .\nD : or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands , also .\nA : but har hard to lose is good .\nA : so it should this question should be hard to lose .\nB : hard to lose .\nA : it's difficult to lose it .\nC : this this is hard to lose .\nB : it is hard to lose .\nB : so then this is it is almost true , so two .\nC : this two , .\nC : and most all because of the option to whoa .\nA : that happens above also .\nA : but when you scroll away and back it will be normal , but .\nA : it isn't , .\nC : put the cor cursor on the .\nD : remote control mainly be sold to younger people .\nB : it will , .\nD : no , don't think very true because the colours .\nD : we have the colours .\nD : we have the buttons is aren't that that much .\nD : nah , the material isn't that so don it's three .\nB : it's it's much more younger .\nC : so ma make it make it two .\nA : it's it's lower number , so better because we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ?\nB : it's two but two two two .\nA : what do you think ?\nC : it's two too , two too too .\nB : let's make everything two .\nD : in the features ?\nA : dissatisfy younger people .\nA : but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features .\nB : it has what did .\nD : because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted lot of features on this thing .\nB : that it doesn't .\nC : not exactly but if it had some games on it like that , but it's for remote control it it would satisfy those needs .\nB : bu but they like the speech .\nC : the speech possibility , the colours .\nB : you could call to your , and the screen , .\nD : screen and scroll .\nC : scroll options , .\nD : they'll be quite met with their expectations .\nB : that that that those are features .\nA : it has relatively few features , with .\nD : it's three features , , the touch screen is feature .\nD : the microphone is feature .\nB : no , aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , and that you can change the options of the remote , something like that .\nA : ours had other features with , you think one , what do you think ?\nD : and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings .\nC : the easy volume up button .\nB : those are features .\nC : remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume .\nC : turn turn up the volume .\nD : so i've chos shou it's it's it's one .\nD : once you've 'cause you have the channel features you have the screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , screen extra , scroll thing extra .\nB : two or three .\nA : i'd say three , so two it is then or .\nD : make it make it two .\nC : one two three .\nD : or make it fucking two .\nB : just another two .\nB : we like two .\nD : you can see the remote control is and .\nB : there's and in front .\nB : it's not the colour , so you should make two , but it has and .\nD : has , do did have nah you have the black one .\nD : and we'll probably make also yellow one .\nB : but not and yellow .\nA : but the logo is on on the front , so two , , that's , that's that's pretty good , ?\nB : one on it's the colours and the it is , but what you think .\nD : x_ marks spot .\nD : and the menu is avail that is available is easy to use .\nC : it's easier to use than regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options entirely explained .\nD : tha that's so true .\nC : instead of just finding out what an icon means on button .\nD : that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it .\nB : and you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with normal t_v_ remote .\nC : you can navigate .\nC : you're not satisfied , .\nD : no , i'm not not convinc .\nC : let's start over again then .\nB : let's make different remote .\nD : let's go for it would be , two .\nB : we only have twos .\nD : so , we have one three , one , that that have to got up .\nB : one three and few ones .\nD : two two two two two .\nB : we mostly have twos , so it's pretty good .\nD : so two , .\nD : the average is two .\nD : that is quite good in my opinion .\nB : we can be happy .\nB : what is it ?\nB : it's like bug .\nA : that was your evaluation show , , so we don't have to calculate anything because of these results .\nD : no , it's two .\nD : the average is two .\nA : let's see , it isn't asked to save but it did already and this everything .\nA : the next part might be little bit difficult to do in group , but am willing to try it .\nA : because we are going to look at the finance and have excel sheet to do that .\nA : and i'm not if put it in the project folder .\nA : look on that .\nA : and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are under or at twelve euro fifty , we're good , and if they're not we're going to re-design , but we have to do that very very quick , yes .\nB : so we're going to erase features .\nA : if put the excel sheet in the not in the folder .\nB : do you have the cost or let's hope .\nD : fifty five euros .\nB : we're going to be here at eight o'clock .\nA : it's it's still in my own documents folder .\nB : we're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock .\nB : perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the excel sheet .\nA : so , this is it .\nB : no , it was in my my information , so .\nC : it it wasn't too much .\nD : you're going scrap scrap it .\nC : as as the screen .\nB : if it doesn't work want to fill it in , but but you should direct the number of we've got battery , one or two batteries , or not ?\nA : could ask one of you to fill it in , so that also take minutes , and the other can use that thing to count numerous functions .\nD : li like write it be , , .\nA : have to count some things and we have to think about some things .\nA : but you have to fill in this column , ?\nC : you got excel to count .\nA : no , count number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , so , but it's it's more about the energy source , ?\nC : dra danny , danny , i'll do that , because draw the no , no solar cell , no no no no .\nD : yea , you design it .\nB : nee one battery , with two small batteries .\nA : do you use hand dynamo , battery , kinetic or solar cells ?\nB : would do battery we do .\nD : no it took battery ?\nB : one battery , ?\nC : no hand dynamo .\nC : hand on advanced chip .\nB : electronics , simple chip advanced chip , ?\nD : we have no , we have sample speaker .\nD : but al but we also have sample speaker , do , we already on nine .\nB : so this one and this one .\nB : we ha we have single what ?\nD : we have double curved .\nC : single nee single curved .\nC : double curved was see ju three dimensional .\nC : but it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in no no no , single curved is like this .\nD : this one is this one is curved like this , .\nB : the the it's not going to work people .\nB : we have rubber .\nA : i'll just fill it in .\nD : it's curved like this .\nD : bu what , but we have curves like it and it .\nC : that's the only curve you made , not curved like that .\nD : there are two curves , ?\nD : understand , understand .\nB : with scroll wheel , ?\nB : is he integrated ?\nC : we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you it won't just pu makes possible to not going to work ?\nD : no , we don't have push button .\nB : , we want it to it's not it's not no .\nB : fifteen , , too bad .\nC : but now button supplements .\nB : but with special colour we have .\nB : special form , ?\nC : we don't got the button supplements .\nB : we don't have any buttons , so , we need to no , we have fifteen and , .\nD : eighteen and half , damn .\nD : we have to lower it with six points .\nD : twelve and half .\nB : we could lose the curve .\nD : we could use we should scrap the sample speaker .\nB : would lose the curve .\nC : we could lose the scroll wheel .\nC : you could make it just regular scroll wheel .\nB : but you can't push it , so you have to tap .\nC : if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window button here and then scroll down with the with with the button .\nA : that will be our best bet .\nB : so normal scroll wheel ?\nC : normal scroll wheel .\nB : and we should lose the curve .\nC : lose , so we don't exactly need the single we don't need curve .\nD : it's four pri it four units .\nB : but if you would it is new feature , it it's something special .\nD : but wha curved then it will be square .\nB : no , the curve doesn't really no , then it will won't stand up from the table .\nC : 's possible to lose curve .\nB : then it would just .\nD : was that does that mean to it , single curve ?\nC : that's meant with scr with curve .\nC : the curve is in dimension .\nC : if you make it flat one , it's no curve , you got no curves .\nB : so we would lose this one ?\nD : but tha that that only is one .\nB : we could , bit .\nC : no , two .\nD : no , one .\nB : sixteen point three .\nD : so we don't , we also have to no , otherwise we don't have an screen .\nB : so we still could could we do it on regular chip on print ?\nC : is it possible to make no .\nB : ma you just can't do that , or we changed , and the single curved to uncurved .\nA : and what did you change ?\nA : you changed the scroll wheel and , but it's just one point , so you should should , you should you should drop the speech recognition .\nD : so that does doesn't doesn't that mu scrap sample speaker ?\nD : that that's yes , four points .\nC : the sample speaker is two , four points .\nB : but it's , but it is it it is new feature , it is something special .\nA : and then you can keep the curve .\nA : or can't you ?\nC : becau when you lose the .\nD : but what what else what else do you want to scrap ?\nD : you have to we have to scrap four points .\nA : or make it on hand dynamo , but don't think that will work .\nD : ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?\nC : no , that's no .\nC : make it when you made it remote control of wood ?\nD : it it , it also it also takes one point less .\nC : you don't make remote control of .\nB : we could make it titanium instead of rubber .\nA : but wooden remote control only helps for old people we discussed , yes ?\nB : can ask something ?\nB : what is special colour ?\nB : is that the wood wood this , we have to have that one too ?\nA : but it's only half .\nA : but the only option is to drop the sample speaker .\nC : to knock the sample speaker , .\nC : and sample sensor .\nB : then we still have too much if we use the , we we scrap that one ?\nC : but , course , but what we'll have .\nC : let's make it thirteen or fourteen .\nB : see , po three .\nB : we need point three .\nD : that's scroll wheel .\nB : don't make it wood .\nD : but wood we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood .\nB : make it , but it's it's special colour , is it all colours ?\nC : special colours , fruity colours .\nB : it's also green or , but it's special colour than just rubber colour .\nD : is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours .\nD : normal colours , yellow , but then don't think we can ever make to twelve and half .\nB : you have to add something to the rubber to make it green .\nB : you don't say here's green rubber .\nC : they don't sell green rubber plants .\nB : you can , you should you have to lose no , it is the scroll wheel , .\nD : but then we have to scrap display , we have to scrap advanced chip .\nC : no no no .\nD : no then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ?\nC : if we lose the scroll wheel and make it depending dependent on the touch screen then it's possible to make .\nD : then we have two .\nD : then we can make add two colours on it .\nC : and then you can and then you can add to the colours .\nD : two colours it .\nC : special , if you lose if you lose the you lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make and then you can make the spec single curve , .\nB : it was such idea .\nD : they can add two colours .\nD : but the colours .\nD : how ma the colours like she told , is the colours we add or , but we we we are we have yellow , red , black , titanium .\nC : how how many colours ?\nB : what do you mean ?\nC : special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make , but when you use more than one colour , it's special colour .\nB : but when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , 'cause you have to add it .\nD : but the rubbers alls original black .\nB : so you always lose the special colour .\nB : you co you could make it always black , like normal remote .\nD : but we're gonna make it yellow red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .\nC : nee we we also want to make ano another colour .\nD : but , because we have more colours than only black .\nB : we have to make this like four or five .\nB : that's what it means .\nA : but isn't it per remote that you pay ?\nD : then don don't think they me mean they're special , , true .\nB : is it per remote ?\nA : you pay half per remote .\nB : , and you one colour per remote .\nA : so each remote with special colour .\nB : so then it is one .\nC : you don't need four of those four of those special colours in one in one remote .\nD : true , true .\nD : we have two points spare .\nA : so the battery , we have advanced chip on print .\nD : nee one point .\nB : so it would be curved , single curve .\nA : because of thing , you can at least make it curved again .\nB : so you just can't make remote .\nA : because that was very important , ?\nB : it's too bad for the speaker .\nA : so it's curved , it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .\nB : should we change that tha that that's one if not , or not ?\nA : we dropped the scroll wheel .\nB : could you copy it ?\nB : and make it the entire perhaps you can then copy page or so .\nA : and the rest is the same , ?\nD : yea the scroll wheel is dropped .\nB : you you made the entire could you not .\nC : undo , undo .\nB : by the perhaps you can save this one , and then copy .\nB : add it copy page .\nA : no , but you .\nB : alright , something went wrong .\nA : but this this new remote we can afford .\nB : it doesn't work .\nD : it should've work .\nC : so you had this list at start ?\nA : no , hadn't .\nC : when did you receive this list ?\nA : they don't work so hard at the finance department .\nC : suppose this is , so we lose the scroll wheel , the and the microphone .\nB : so too bad .\nA : and that's it .\nB : and we changed something , , or not ?\nA : twelve euro fifty .\nA : and did you try to make new design , or what were you trying to do ?\nB : tried to copy that one , but it didn't work .\nA : it didn't work .\nB : so we could fix it like tha that it's like this .\nB : you could select it all , but then you can't erase .\nA : you can arrange , can't you then just say copy ?\nC : you can only re erase ?\nB : when you saw li earlier when we selected it , couldn't erase anything .\nB : just tap somewhere .\nC : just up somewhere besides it , .\nD : just tap somewhere .\nA : and now you can erase .\nB : don't think , but we can try .\nC : we already try .\nA : should be possible .\nB : , no , .\nA : you can draw over it with white pen .\nB : we tried it earlier .\nB : it's very much work .\nA : but that's also useful for the evaluation , because we have prototype now which we can afford and we only need to draw little bit to get good design .\nA : and we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .\nD : and erase the mic .\nC : all need is no mic .\nA : let's see , we can save this now .\nB : already erased half of the line .\nC : bon chance no , add .\nA : and move back to here .\nB : too bad , .\nA : and then all green .\nD : looks like ipod .\nA : but you can erase that .\nB : that's bit weird .\nB : now i'm line .\nC : difference between lines and text and the pen .\nD : all need is mic .\nA : and you can't erase this ?\nB : no , it's weird .\nA : just leave it at this and quickly save .\nA : and then we are going to the project or product evaluation .\nC : looks fucking boring now .\nA : we just did our project evaluation .\nA : sit for that since it's almost my final slide .\nA : what did you think about the process ?\nA : how satisfied are we ?\nC : deadlines were sometimes very short .\nB : bu but stressful .\nC : but and stressful .\nB : you think , no , my presentation isn't ready .\nD : we it should be it would be better if we worked little bit together .\nD : now we worked through each other , something he said , and you had information also had , so some some things had in my presentation , they already told , so so , that don't think that is the best way to work at for such project .\nA : and you could ask things .\nB : you had information didn't have and then .\nA : and for me it sometimes was surprise who was going to present what , ?\nA : so you would say communicate during our individual work .\nD : no , or session of five minutes together , and then work separate .\nC : but but why not work here together , ?\nC : why should we be separated from each other in those difference different rooms ?\nA : probably to simulate the whole working process , , you can't have meeting for several weeks .\nB : but then you can work together too when chat would also be , don't really like the board , it doesn't really work .\nD : like she told .\nD : then you can work together too by mail or by , , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other .\nD : don't think that was the best way , but , the technology's .\nC : but the technology was fantastic .\nD : but don do becau that's because .\nC : perhaps it is , perhaps it is easier to get one of those dig digital pens or so and to and lay it next to that keyboard over there .\nB : it does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't .\nC : so you can draw see it over on the screen .\nD : like the like plotters , .\nA : so you don't think the smartboard is is really useful or , so it's bit unnatural also .\nB : but is useful , but it doesn't really work all the time .\nC : it's useful , but not because when you put this pen on the screen for exam and line is being drawn at at two or three centimetres below .\nD : it is useful , but no .\nB : the pen doesn't the line is bit off .\nB : you can point to where you want the line to be .\nC : the project because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to have , you didn't have time to to make very qualitati qualitative presentation .\nC : so you used this the different powerpoint presentations in which you put your material in the .\nA : that wasn't me .\nA : so the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about this digital pen ?\nB : used it , it it was you can use it , it's quite handy .\nD : didn't use it .\nA : use it as normal pen and and and only you use it to get it on the computer , ?\nC : but didn't used it too , but .\nB : used it to to , it did work pretty .\nB : don't think why you would want to use it actually , but it it does work .\nC : because it shou to make some designs , it is very easy .\nD : it is it is , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer .\nB : and then you can show it to everybody .\nC : but to write it .\nD : it's bi little bit too big to write .\nB : it doesn't really write normally .\nC : it's too big , it's too fat .\nD : fat document , those .\nA : and what about the teamwork ?\nD : team work was .\nB : it was , .\nD : only thing that we worked through , past each other .\nA : we , but that was it was our assignment , ?\nD : with some things that was only problem , but , but furthermore better .\nB : but it was because we didn't .\nA : and should walk out of the room when you discuss this point , the leadership .\nD : that's , no prob .\nB : it was good , but .\nC : not too much , not too too too too .\nA : when we look at this i'd say we have been creative , ?\nA : but there was room for you did ?\nC : or the room for it was the idea to be creative , so you got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out .\nB : and you get get from the from the computer , but .\nC : the information was sometimes little bit too late or .\nD : little bit lo .\nD : too late it it it took lot of time before you got your ema .\nB : you just sit there for ten minutes .\nB : where is that email ?\nD : played seven times solitaire something .\nA : didn't have time for that .\nB : is it on there ?\nD : wha , it is there .\nB : is it on there ?\nB : didn't find the didn't look but didn't look , but got like one email after ten minutes .\nA : at some times sometimes received like like five emails at at one moment , and then even got spam .\nC : was searching and searching .\nD : no , never got that .\nB : that's what we said .\nD : so does this lik and information was bit low , sometimes , in in in in the beginning didn't understand what what to do .\nB : and it not lot no , the first one .\nC : no , didn't know make .\nD : like with with the remote and never new we have we had to made made rec remote control .\nB : didn't know nee .\nB : and didn't to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , so went , .\nD : so so , .\nC : no stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page .\nA : and was working and working and work , but after all we can say we are satisfied , but it it could've been better .\nB : just looking at the screen and , an , that will be handy .\nA : when we get when we have we would have gotten more information .\nC : more information about the costs .\nC : first of all didn't think that we were able to make an screen first point , but it was possible , .\nD : it only costs four units .\nB : yea so tha actually you could make an screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no screen , when you look at that .\nA : that was bit mean to put it in the end .\nA : and what were the other points to to improve this whole process ?\nB : think that's about it .\nD : we got it already .\nB : heavier less heavy laptops .\nA : they're pretty heavy .\nC : they were they were just fine .\nB : but that's not really .\nD : and furthermore the the the network was .\nD : everything you loaded was also av available there .\nA : and so more time might have improved the the quality of work , is what you say .\nD : but that it's now half past four half past three , so , .\nB : but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone .\nB : then it pops up pop up screen came .\nB : five minutes in the meeting .\nA : so more time during the individual work phases .\nA : got my warning for the last five minutes , so i'll move on to my last slide , yes , which is the closing .\nA : we managed , but we did it very quickly .\nA : if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , , this is it , but we had to do it , , because we have to have design , and that is within the budget .\nA : and we evaluated .\nA : we should re-evaluate the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project .\nA : and everybody's very happy .\nA : at least am , with the results , so celebration , , for the three of you , because have to write the final report now .\nA : but , very much for your co-operation , and had very day so far .\nB : do we get another email ?\nA : have we also have to go to our own rooms again , but at least .\nB : we have to fill in questionnaire again , but we do ?\nA : but you can try to make screen shot of this , so try to include it in the final report .\nB : that that one ?\nC : you cannot you can save it .\nB : you can just , but it's it isn't picture or , , is it ?\nA : wants to , but at least this one .\nA : know , we should remove this , but it won't .\nC : you file save as the j_ peg j_ peg .\nA : and put it in the project folder then , .\nD : can you find it as j_ peg ?\nB : no , isn't possible .\nB : but you can make screen shot , .\nA : hereby officially close the meeting and hope to see you soon .\nD : in celebra or shouldn't ?\nC : in about five minutes .\nA : we'll be bit bit longer , but .\nA : happy celebration , ?\nC : let's let's have party .\nB : how big do you want the images ?\nC : let's have some fun .\nA : not too big .\nA : whatever you good .\nC : no that is one thousand twenty four .\nD : eight hundred six hundred is better .\nC : if it browse .\nD : nah , name .\nB : isn't on the desktop .\nC : do not know .\nB : you can only save it in my documents .\nB : can we stay here ?\nB : why can't we stay here ?\nD : celebration time , come on .\nD : peace out nigger ."], ["<t> The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops.

.\nB : joost , your mouse .\nB : no mouse needed ?\nD : i've got touch-pad .\nD : do how how wake it up ?\nD : no , my laptop .\nD : you with your brilliant ideas .\nD : if touch the power button .\nD : do how how wake it up ?\nA : try the power button .\nD : come on , move it .\nD : now , wake up , bitch .\nC : i've lost my screen .\nD : that wasn that wasn't very smart , .\nD : get back to me .\nC : closed the no .\nB : you've got your name .\nA : my name is name .\nD : no , didn't restart it , closed it .\nB : hope it working .\nB : never close your laptop .\nA : welcome to the kick-off meeting .\nA : forgot to put my name over here , it's it's martin .\nA : so you all know .\nA : this is the agenda for today .\nA : the opening is what i'm doing now .\nA : we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things .\nA : give some examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing .\nA : we have twenty five minutes .\nA : the project aim is to design new remote control .\nA : some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly .\nA : so now we all our goal is .\nA : forget forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other .\nA : we all know each other's names .\nA : joost , guido , antek .\nB : what is your name ?\nA : we al already been through that part .\nA : it consists of three levels of design .\nA : we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design .\nA : every level of design consists of some individual work , and we close it with meeting .\nA : you all received an email with example of our explanation of what the particular level of design means to the different functions , and you you probably read that already , so don't have to tell you about that .\nA : first we're gonna gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these meeting tools .\nA : we have the smart-boards , the thes those two boards .\nA : this is the presentation boards , wh which one i'm using now .\nA : you can there's document folder called the sh shared document folder .\nA : you can upload your documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your powerpoint presentations on this screen .\nA : we also have the white-board .\nA : we're gonna skip through no , no .\nB : can we see the white-board on our laptops ?\nA : just on the on the screen over there .\nB : no , saw saw the file , the smart-board that x_b_k_ but .\nA : probably is , but if the software is on the laptop .\nA : is is if it's mainly thing for in the meeting , so don't t's if it's important .\nA : this an explanation of the smart-boards .\nA : there is tool-bar over here .\nA : it's quite simple .\nA : you have the the pen function , eraser function .\nA : it's like very simple paint application .\nA : we , we use the same file during the whole day , and you can make new sheets by by pu puttin pressing on the blank button .\nA : it works like this .\nA : if pen is selected , yes .\nB : with that pen ?\nA : it's not but it is pen .\nA : it's not working like pen yet .\nA : it's doing some now .\nB : little bit slower .\nA : so you can use pen .\nA : you can use an eraser .\nA : and you can make new fi new blanks , and you can change the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which you have to select pen format .\nA : and then select current colour or line width .\nA : so , it's quite easy .\nA : now you're all acquainted with the different tools .\nA : we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards .\nA : every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths .\nA : i'll start off then .\nA : i'll use this same sheet .\nA : let me think .\nA : i'm gonna draw piranha .\nA : i'm gonna use some different colour now .\nA : some little white .\nA : looks like fish .\nA : this is black ?\nA : this is just useless drawings but teeth .\nA : they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is .\nA : what was have su to sum up its favourite characteris , like its sharp razor sharp teeth .\nA : plus , the the big forehead and small , small actual face .\nA : and like its overall aggressive look and , that's what like about piranha .\nA : that's what the intention should be .\nA : who wants to be next ?\nA : you go , guido ?\nA : make new sheet .\nA : it's by pressing on blank .\nB : then pen again ?\nA : and so in the format menu you can choose the different colours and pen widths .\nB : what my favourite animal is , but the easiest animal is bird .\nB : will that's my bird .\nD : of that actually .\nB : isn't it quite it's little bit light .\nB : that's another one .\nA : tell us something about your favourite characteristics of these particular birds .\nB : ano it's , it's the most simple animal know , .\nB : because there's there's some free in the sky like that .\nA : no , it's clear .\nB : so more birds ?\nA : we get your point .\nA : who wants to be next ?\nD : i'll go next .\nD : haven't got favourite animal too , so .\nD : what should draw ?\nD : i'll draw penguin .\nD : i'll draw penguin .\nD : 't draw , so you can start to laugh already .\nA : i'll do so .\nD : something like that .\nB : it's little bit hard .\nD : it's better than your bird .\nD : everything's better than your bird .\nD : like its ugliness and , whatever .\nD : the way it walks or whatever .\nC : i'm going to draw cat .\nC : why , but cat is very smart animal .\nC : and you can have them at home .\nC : which is not as the case with with bingwings and ye yes , .\nA : you can have piranha at home .\nB : don't mess with my birds , .\nC : it's not very very good drawn , but you can see cat from it .\nD : it's handicapped cat .\nA : don't think don't think darwin would agree with that .\nC : it's , it's not scared .\nC : he's crying but it's most cats are small .\nD : he's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness .\nA : what do you like about it then ?\nC : you can handle them .\nA : and then we are through the tool training , .\nD : wouldn't call it training , but alright .\nA : this is something about the project finance .\nA : the selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five euros .\nA : and our profit aim is fifteen million euros .\nA : we're very ambitious on this one .\nA : the market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control .\nA : so that's clear .\nA : we're now gonna discuss some when , we're gonna brainstorm about what kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be .\nA : tell me about your experiences with the remote controls .\nA : do you have good experiences with remote controls ?\nA : or do they annoy you sometimes ?\nA : are they difficult to understand , or they don't interact with different equipment very ?\nD : don't don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new t_v_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever .\nD : and then different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions are removed , or whatever .\nD : so what we need is is clear remote control with grouped buttons , .\nD : all all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to , , to minimise it to this this or whatever other functions somewhere else .\nA : different functions of of .\nD : we should group them .\nD : and same for the for the volume buttons and the the was was thinking since t_v_ is mostly used together with v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player or recorder , and not with stereo , it should be good to include functions for v_c_r_s and d_v_d_ players , recorders .\nA : and , is it gonna be remote control that's what it can be used for different equipment , like your t_v_ and your home stereo ?\nA : but , the d_v_d_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably .\nA : it's what , from my experience .\nB : but isn't it it's only for television , .\nD : hi-fi set is not often used as know of in combination with television .\nA : but we gonna , it is only for televis so wha what what wha what what document but , where where did it where did you find that ?\nB : not it was only for television .\nB : so so we probably don't have to have to have the functions for d_v_d_ player or v_c_r_ .\nD : yes , it is only for television , but ll we we're gonna brainstorm about that .\nD : if we t's useful , we do it .\nB : in the email .\nB : it said , television remote control .\nD : it's television remote control .\nD : but was thinking since it is useful with d_v_d_ .\nC : yes , yes , that's something extras .\nA : but most television remote controls support other functions as .\nA : so we can no , we have to think about that .\nA : but we've gonna put some is is it so user-friendliness , is is pri priority in this case , or .\nD : also no one's gonna buy it .\nC : only the experts .\nA : this the is some aspect of the , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful .\nA : that , then you're you're the usability man , so this gonna be very important task for you then .\nA : how can we make it trendy ?\nA : do by just sh shape and the look of it ?\nC : to go with to go with fashion and team leader .\nA : can opener underneath it ?\nB : for the bear .\nA : or someth something special , like m_p_ three player inside of it , or , then the production costs are gonna be too high probably .\nB : no it , yo we have to keep it simple , to get whole market .\nD : way too high .\nB : it's international , so we have to use standard .\nA : with different type of fronts or , has to be something spectacular or one which makes it we gonna skip back to the goals probably .\nD : that's an idea , .\nA : original , trendly , and user-friendly , we al also already talked about user-friendliness .\nA : no , something trendy and original , that that goes hand in hand .\nA : when something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that .\nA : so you the technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what equipment you want to , , you want to manage with it .\nA : and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it .\nA : and you should look out for what makes it trendy .\nA : , like some special feature .\nA : or some does it does it gets some gadgetness .\nD : yes , what the market wishes .\nA : next meeting starts in thirty minutes .\nA : individual , so .\nA : the the industrial designer will or the working design , , we will already said that .\nA : the user interface designer is it user inter user interface the technical functions design .\nB : interface , don't didn't get message .\nA : and the management expert of the marketing expert .\nA : user requirements specifi , this one was already clear to us .\nA : specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nA : how much time we have left .\nA : we started at twelve .\nD : you just got message .\nA : and what does it said ?\nD : and it said five minutes , so we got four and half .\nA : no , we're ahead of schedule then .\nD : he's the whatever .\nB : the project manager .\nD : he is the whatever .\nA : i'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes .\nA : and it's it's clear you can put the in the project documents presentations .\nA : you can all or we're all .\nD : project joc project documents is for showing on the white-board .\nA : but we're all familiar with microsoft powerpoint , are we ?\nA : i'm gonna wri write some down and then we're ready .\nA : or we can leave already .\nA : or or sh or should we or is important that we leave at exact .\nB : don't think will need it .\nA : we'll see each other in thirty minutes .\nD : will need it ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting. </t>  <t> The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components. </t>  <t> The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included. </t>  <t> He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users. </t>  <t> The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel. </t>  <t> He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons. </t>  <t> The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features. </t>  <t> He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost. </t>  <t> The project manager informed the group of new requirements. </t>  <t> The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan. </t>  <t> The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have, and whether to include DVD/VCR controls, a teletext button, stop button, changeable covers, and a base/recharger with locator function. </t>  <t> The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost. </t>  <t> The project manager will write up the minutes, and put the minutes from both this meeting and the previous one in the project folder. </t>  <t> The marketing expert, industrial designer and user interface designer will have thirty minutes after lunch to work on their individual presentations. </t>  <t> The remote will have a simple, trendy design, with some kind of special feature that makes it stand out. </t>  <t> If the budget allows it the remote will include a base unit with a locator function, which will also act as a recharger. </t>  <t> Even though the new project requirements stated that teletext was outdated, the group felt they should still include one teletext button. </t>  <t> The group were still unsure whether to include some DVD/VCR functions on the remote. </t>  <t> The group had difficulty deciding what special feature they should include to make their product stand out. </t>  <t> The group were not sure whether to include a base/recharger for the remote. </t>  <t> They were not sure how much a recharger would cost to make. </t> ", "B : here we go again .\nC : my mouse is not working anymore .\nC : he's when put it in , is is going to beep beep beep .\nD : got little screen here over here .\nD : got like this big black border on every side .\nD : i'll i'll fix it .\nA : welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by maarten .\nA : this is the agenda , the opening .\nA : we've got three presentations .\nA : and i'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me .\nA : and we're gonna make decision on the remote control functions .\nA : we have forty minutes .\nA : this is the the closing already .\nA : so start off with the the first presentation then .\nA : in we have to do it in in order .\nA : the , it that .\nD : what the order is .\nA : it won't doesn't we should start with the the technical functions .\nC : how can get this on the whiteboard ?\nA : t's you dumped the file in the in the sh in the project document folder .\nC : i've done that .\nA : you've already done that ?\nB : no can that open .\nA : let's close this one .\nA : we'll just open new one .\nB : open it there .\nA : have to say something .\nA : due to some technical problems haven't digitized the last the meeting minutes .\nA : but i'll make that happens next time .\nB : about the get .\nA : and i'll get this one in digital form too .\nC : we're going to talk about working design .\nC : the method of the remote control is electrical energy , it activates chip in the remote .\nC : it's an electrical circuit which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television .\nC : it's nowadays very known , known technology .\nC : the known technology can make cost very low .\nC : it's wild wide sale of remote controls in the world .\nC : and and the components are very very cheap .\nC : , diodes , bat batteries and led lights , they're needed and they're everywhere available .\nC : again , it's fair price .\nC : it's common technology , like told , the circuit board , it's the most important part of the remote control .\nC : we can use for that fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is can be made as fast as printing paper .\nC : it's it's all very , they're making it all the time .\nC : and it's not very specialised technology .\nC : haven't come to here , but i've got some images of remote controls .\nC : they were not very trendy or just just remote control like everyone knows .\nC : so why should put it here .\nC : yes , but haven't made it because of the time .\nA : but it's the technical side of the remote control .\nA : we'll we'll have to skip that part then .\nA : but you don't t's problem to design the technical part of the remote control ?\nA : it's gonna be easy ?\nB : but nothing restricted for user interface ?\nC : no , it's it's just part of known technology , .\nC : remote control is nothing special nowadays .\nA : regardless of what type of functions we want to implement .\nA : doesn't really matter .\nC : don't , because of the all the televisions there are few couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on on standard remote ?\nB : the technical functions .\nA : we'll see later on .\nB : if you got the same pictures as got , but got these two , and they're we have to focus on the one hand the expert view or the novice user .\nB : it's it's very much depending on the user requirements , don't know who's doing , but it that's very important to watch what functions there we want to put in remote control .\nA : will there be some user requirements later on ?\nA : the ones i've received from the account manager .\nA : we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .\nB : we can put functions in it when , when we get the user requirements and we can update it .\nA : but this real this big distinction between this type of remote .\nA : we should we should choose one we should not compromise but really choose for expert viewer or novice ?\nD : yes , agree .\nA : what that's what you want trying to say .\nB : if you want try huge market , if you want to reach huge market , like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user .\nB : it's it's really depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in in use .\nA : some of these , .\nA : some of that will , but but it will be more clear when we come to the some of the new requirements .\nB : there are at least basic functions , like just the channels one till nine , on and off switch , which must be clear with red button like that .\nB : most standard have volume , , and mute function , and , , the next and previous channel .\nB : that's just basic what we need .\nB : and from that on we can user requirements what we need more .\nB : joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and if there are any if you put more functions , more buttons , it's com becoming less trendy like that .\nB : you can just you can you can keep it in mind that .\nD : haven't really found conclusion like that .\nB : the the with less buttons you can make more trendier , more trendier design , .\nB : , that's all have to say , .\nB : that was it .\nA : then the marketing expert can tell us something about the current market .\nD : alright , i've done some research for functional requirements .\nD : the working method there were hundred one hundred people , how do you say , watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also filled out questionnaire with few questions .\nD : i've lined them up here .\nD : ask whether common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and and like that .\nD : have found some interesting things .\nD : we do we do got market .\nD : three out of four people claim to find remote controls ugly .\nD : so if we make trendy design , we have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .\nD : three out of four users zaps lot , as quoted here from the results .\nD : zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour .\nD : that's quite lot .\nD : relevant options are , , power buttons .\nD : although , only used once per hour .\nD : channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more , , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and very much used .\nD : furthermore , fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on remote control .\nD : that doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off .\nD : but it says we shouldn't make it too complicated .\nD : fifty percent also claims to have lost remote control very often in the room .\nD : and an important thing here , the most important customers , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old .\nD : and elderly people , our market , are less interested in features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls .\nD : so , what was thinking , wrong side .\nD : we shouldn't implement too much features on on our remote control , because elderly people will get lost .\nD : group features for higher usability , what was claiming in the previous meeting .\nD : all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them on one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and , it there are lot of options there , so we can really make , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .\nD : and , if you want to implement v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ options , group them in the button , not too .\nD : small buttons , so they won't be very , how do you say yes , won't be very present , .\nD : and trendy look , , although seventy percent of the market is consists of elderly people who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent .\nD : that was what found .\nA : then we i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on what features we find important .\nA : some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite irrelevant , .\nA : because decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward .\nA : now see four .\nA : that's kinda strange .\nA : they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet .\nA : that may be so , but , we can't just leave the teletext button off .\nD : no , agree , agree .\nA : it's impossible , .\nA : so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , , like on and off , and don't make lot of special put lot of special features on it to make it transparent or , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much .\nD : not too much , no .\nA : so we have to think of that .\nA : the remote control should only be used for television .\nA : otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time ma the time to market .\nA : so we should leave all d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ related features off completely .\nA : that that's what they're trying to say .\nA : our current customers are within the age group of forty plus .\nA : new products should reach new market with customers that are younger than forty .\nA : so you talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on remote control and who were interested .\nA : but , , they're not relevant because we are aiming at younger , but it is it's is dif it's fact that the that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that .\nD : don't really agree actually , to be honest .\nD : it's very small market which we will approach then if we want to reach customers younger than forty .\nD : it's only like thirty percent of the total market .\nA : our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , , new customer group .\nA : that's the one we haven't covered yet .\nA : so that's what the problem is .\nA : we haven't got remote controls for , .\nD : we can compromise little bit .\nA : if it's no no , but we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants .\nD : not too much then , bu alright .\nA : so we can make remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .\nA : our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products .\nA : our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .\nA : something else to know .\nB : but what's our slogan ?\nA : you will have to look that up .\nB : the slogan puts fashion in electronics .\nD : i'll have look .\nD : we put the fashion in electronics .\nA : it's something about the , .\nA : it might be , let's make things better , but , let's go back to the the agenda .\nD : sense and simplicity .\nA : so we've now had to the three presentations .\nA : we know about the new project requirements .\nA : that means we can , discuss on the remote control functions .\nA : if make start , it's becoming more clear what remote control it's gonna be , and already talked about the you have familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it .\nA : we're we're looking for some , we we're looking for really simple remote control with only basic t_v_ functions .\nD : to be honest , if our aim group is till forty , not older than forty , that's not very , we don't really need to have simple remote control .\nD : we can implement more functions then , because the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be more yes .\nB : but wha but , but you sai you said that that lot of functions aren't used .\nA : that's why lot of the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , they are are are contradicting each other , because they want simpler design , and no other functions than just t_v_ , but they do aim at younger , ma but you we can make some discuss distinctions in what kin in the , know , in functions you have you have different equipment in your room , like t_v_ and d_v_d_ player .\nB : so why should we put this function in ?\nB : more people younger people are more looking for just trendy look than more functions .\nA : you can , know , you you can make very you can put very detailed functions regarding the t_v_ set on your remote control with the with the , , audio settings and screen settings .\nA : we don't want that .\nA : that was that became clear .\nA : we don't want .\nA : but we should put some func , know that the younger people will most likely have d_v_d_ player they want to , , they want to control , remotely .\nB : but you said , , but the functions are not in the remote control we're making .\nA : no , , the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to but .\nA : we should , should put some functions for other for other equipment on it .\nA : but just the basic functions .\nA : like rewind and wind , or what what do you think ?\nC : but you can put them under the same button .\nD : not much more than that .\nA : if as far as possible .\nD : or we can we could put behind the flip-flap or whatever .\nA : but what do you think ?\nA : do should we implement features that or functions that to control other devices ?\nA : no , you don't ?\nB : no , new requirements say no .\nA : the new requirements say so .\nB : so , but if it's too simple they won't use the remote control , they use their own with lot more functions .\nC : but you can put play and stop and and rewind .\nA : it's there there there is something most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as as their their own remote control .\nA : lot of d_v_d_ players have some tricky settings with , exactly .\nC : yes , but we .\nA : that's that's wha no no , you don't no no , you don't need it .\nD : but but for , v_c_r_ , that's better example in this case .\nD : on remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme the v_c_r_ to start recording at three p_m_ or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and fast forward .\nB : no , no .\nA : no , no .\nA : but we have to think we have to think d_v_d_ , , so but from my experience it's kinda lot of d_v_d_ players , , like forwarding , goes differently .\nD : know , but yes .\nA : you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed .\nA : it's sometimes bit difficult .\nA : if we just leave the d_v_d_ functional , was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , we should focus on the t_v_ then .\nB : but just keep it simple and look more at no .\nA : and and it's just an complimentary remote and not universal one .\nA : if you want to keep it simple , you can make universal remote .\nB : it's only for television .\nC : yes , but there are there are but how wi how will you be able to handle whole market ?\nA : it's just it it should be something that is like gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .\nA : but what televis , we we'll make this one trendy .\nC : there are dozen of dozens of of remote controls that have yes , but you could put on the on the zap buttons you can put it to to access all the same pages .\nB : the user interface is easy .\nA : we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions .\nA : so we should put zap buttons on it .\nA : also numbers , to to go to the specific channels .\nB : and the basic , basic functions , .\nD : yes , definitely , .\nA : , teletext button should be there .\nB : it's too much integrated in the other .\nA : but just one big teletext button , on and off .\nD : and two or three other options , but not nothing more than that .\nD : stop function is very useful .\nD : if you have page which consists of more pages , and you are not very quick reader , then it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but , use it very regularly , the action .\nA : but that becomes too difficult , it's not very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .\nD : re use it quite often .\nA : , but you , you do , but i've never heard of it in the first place .\nB : will you look look at the market .\nA : and we have to , and and teletext is becoming outdated .\nA : we just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably .\nA : that that's kin getting too complex for our remote .\nB : , it's sunday always use it for the , for the soccer , when you when you look , couple of weeks ago looked at the for the flights , and there are lot of flights in one page , so if if , but true .\nA : what you think .\nA : but do you like to have such stop button ?\nA : or do you it's very rare and special function .\nA : it goes , but that's we should do on the internet now .\nA : that's why it was said in the in the use in the new requirements .\nC : if you have seven pages , you can go up and down .\nA : lots of new televisions can store pages , , and then you can just skip manually through them using we should just put one teletext button on it .\nA : then we meet the new requirements .\nA : we also meet the other thin you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , .\nA : , what functions do we have to decide on ?\nA : or do we if we have stif specifically name all the functions we we want .\nA : we have the zap and the volume .\nA : should we do make them very big ?\nA : the the the zap button .\nA : that's that's that's considered to be trendy also .\nD : the plus and the minus button should be quite present , .\nB : but trendy , .\nA : or you should place them on , in special way ?\nC : we can make joystick .\nA : something or somethin special way to to zap through the it has to it has to be , and quick .\nA : you have to use it very quickly .\nB : it was true .\nD : if you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus .\nA : and it the buttons should make it possible to to zap through your channels in rapid at rapid pace .\nA : what should we decide on then ?\nA : in in case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which weren't worked out already , but it shouldn't be problem then .\nC : but no , it's just signals and the television does the rest .\nB : we the batteries .\nA : no , , but we don't have to , when we don't want to control other devices , it makes it even more simple .\nB : if you use large batteries or small batter batteries .\nC : the most standard batteries .\nA : that we should use , not not the the watch kind the most , it has to be simple , and wi which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , .\nD : the most ordinary batteries .\nA : how much time do we ha we have left ?\nA : more than thirty minutes ?\nD : about twenty minutes .\nA : ten twenty minutes .\nC : but in way we have to be special .\nA : these these shouldn't .\nA : but that's that's do you have you have you think about tha thought about that ?\nA : how we can what the extra touch can be .\nC : for the remote control .\nA : do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget feature or , it was something about how we lose them .\nA : it should be remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget thing .\nD : that's that's more for for an age range or ten to twelve or whatever .\nB : to find him .\nA : nah , lot of people like to have such kind gay things .\nA : it it should be like birthday present that you give someone , and it is has something .\nD : , that's good one , .\nA : or it should have big light that can flash on it , or it should or an or the like the the can opener .\nA : it contains some feature that you don't normally link to remote control .\nA : it's very impor because we're gonna make such basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special .\nA : it's gonna cost twenty five euros .\nD : ye the can opener is brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not rare combination .\nA : but the , it's already been done .\nA : but and it's gonna be very it has to be sturdy , so with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor .\nA : it has to be used something special , and you really it has to , not people , when they buy it , they have to think , this one lasts for long time .\nA : we're really gonna use them .\nA : not some thing you you throw away next week , .\nD : no , that's true .\nA : so that's that's when when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , it's very important to find something like this .\nA : so there's very important task for you .\nA : and we can all think about it .\nB : be original , .\nA : also for you , when you it's very when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and and al as in friend use friendly as , .\nB : and use friendly , .\nA : so big buttons , flashy design , and some gadget thing .\nD : swapable front or whatever .\nA : or just different colours would be if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their remote control .\nA : it could be be , you never know , but but it and we have to make it quite big .\nB : more money for us .\nD : yes , definitely , definitely .\nA : people so , and and also because it is expensive .\nC : that's to be formed for your hand .\nA : if you want it to be something , , it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it make it .\nD : yes , it it it should be be visible nearly anywhere in the room .\nD : as as said during my presentation , fifty percent .\nA : and shou and should ni look when you put it on table .\nA : you might wanna put it , that it it it it stands up .\nA : you have to put it on its so it's like vase or something you put on table .\nA : no no , put inside it .\nC : more like joystick then .\nA : but , it's like like statue , but , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in that it's it's fashionable .\nD : , see what you mean , .\nB : it's like you have four phones .\nB : something like that .\nD : if you do that , but if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and half euros .\nD : in in the base we could like make button , and if you push it , the remote control itself makes noise .\nD : that's probably stupid , but as found here , fifty percent , was it fifty ?\nC : but that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second or you can .\nD : fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control .\nA : but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it , .\nD : no , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in .\nB : on the television .\nD : if an button in in that , you can ma make rechargeable one , .\nA : and then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it chargeable .\nA : that , but , the pro no , that it might be , nee but we don't .\nA : you , but we much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on remote control and it's basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that st , rechargeable units .\nD : it should only cost twelve and half euros , .\nA : but we would ma we'd do it in taiwan and so , it's not gonna be that expen it's idea .\nB : it should be possible .\nB : it's good idea .\nA : some be i've never seen that before , and you make it be , you see it with the mo the mouses nowadays .\nB : to make base ?\nD : yes , definitely .\nC : yes , but is that handy ?\nA : t's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem .\nB : it's it's it's it's it's not the purpose to be handy , it's .\nA : and you can always find your remote control up , .\nC : but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last two years , three years , with with two batteries .\nA : , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need also an , also you would need battery in the the base unit as , .\nC : and then you yes .\nA : does it makes it kinda , .\nD : you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , .\nC : or but you pay for it .\nB : but that's not it's ugly , .\nA : but then it's very easy to make it also rechargeab don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also recharge function in it .\nD : on the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make bay .\nD : it looks trendy and still still put bleep function in it , but the bay is definitely , why not .\nA : it's good idea .\nA : and make it , , we we , we it's it isn't most costly remote control .\nA : we can save on the on the functions .\nA : we just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make there's some noise that it can make , or probably some cheap light thing around it or that it that it lights up , it's also .\nA : and if you put it away , it's we have to we that's it's not easy market .\nA : we have to something special .\nA : and for twenty five euros people want something remote special from your mote control , and we can't deliver that in with regards to the functions , because we aren't gonna put .\nD : with eye candy , ear candy , whatever .\nA : and then when make it , , looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing .\nA : it's good idea .\nB : it must be must be gadget to have .\nA : if it let's , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that .\nA : and we even try to save up on other to make we can do such thing .\nA : and the first thing we the most likeable thing to to to skip is then probably the recharge function .\nA : if that's too expensive , we won't do that .\nB : we or just give beep when the battery's out or down .\nA : but it would be .\nD : it would be , yes .\nA : it's the idea .\nA : know that batteries last long nowadays .\nA : and and what people just think about , , i'll never have to buy any batteries again , so because it's very annoying when your battery is empty .\nA : and then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo i've experienced that that , .\nD : most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes .\nA : so , easy functions .\nA : we will we will we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi .\nA : but it's also annoying .\nA : 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it .\nA : then it beeps all the time and .\nD : no , that's true .\nA : you don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable .\nA : and you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it .\nA : in the in the ma , but it , if if they pay for it because they think , , that's idea , i'm gonna use it .\nA : and when it , , when time goes by and they think , , i'll never put him in the recharger , last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then .\nA : then when they look get know for that everybody who buys this remote control , within couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and just push the button and , it's brilliant .\nD : bleep bleep bleep , there it is , .\nA : i've never it's so simple , but i've never seen it .\nB : and you can leave it just there .\nA : we should really do this .\nA : now , , how much time have we got left ?\nA : these clocks aren't synched .\nA : now i've put , it is twenty , so we have ten minutes ?\nB : i'll fifteen minutes .\nD : something like that , .\nA : but we're we're done .\nA : we've decided on the functions .\nA : there is some .\nA : there is closing sheet .\nA : we have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .\nA : i'll make i'll had some problems with the digitising the the first minutes , the the the next minutes won't be problem , but i'll try to make the first one will be in the folder too , but it won't work , but you'll see .\nA : these are more important than the first ones , so .\nB : can you make an part of folder for the minutes ?\nB : that not not everything in one one folder .\nD : maarten , five minutes .\nA : because did the first minutes did were were were bit scratchy , .\nA : then did second one with nicer layout , which could , know , use for the other ones , but think forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write second it's get it's not working when you try to write second paper .\nD : no , that's true , .\nA : and then you you had to overwrite it or someth .\nA : becau , it was not my pen .\nD : should we by the way draw on our whiteboard , little idea of .\nA : this looks you like .\nA : of the shape .\nB : or the sh do you get an idea of the shape ?\nA : probably , it would be .\nD : has anyone got little bit detailed ideas about the shape ?\nD : don't , for one .\nC : like this pen .\nD : bit bigger , but the shape is , it's something different , and we want we want that .\nA : no , bigger .\nB : little bit bigger , but , look look at the pictures .\nC : it has to feel in your hand .\nA : have to say , have this can opening remote control in my head most of all , or some we should no , that will be too costly .\nA : we shou we could also , that was would also be an idea , but don't if it exists already , you should like make alessi design it .\nA : that would also be .\nA : but that's gonna then you then you don't , but then you don't have it that's not something that's in the production cost one it's one time , was it's single cost .\nD : but twelve and half euros ?\nA : but but then you can nah , don't thin that it would be more expensive , because i've bought the alessi more often and even small pencil holders are more expensive .\nA : would be idea though .\nA : it has to be it has to have round forms .\nA : like something like that or so or so and on and then base unit underneath it .\nD : something like that is very ergonomic .\nA : it's also round .\nA : put it in there wire on it .\nA : , some some lights , big but .\nB : flash lights at the side .\nA : volume and programme , .\nB : at the side , like that .\nD : yes , volume and programme should be there , because you hands wi your hands will be in the smaller part .\nA : and some of the extra funct some of the extra functions over here .\nD : and the numbers on top , .\nA : and and lights ?\nA : how we're , ring of no , no , you have to on the side of it .\nD : ro roun rounds .\nB : side of it .\nA : along the side strip of .\nB : just two leds on the side .\nD : lights also around the volume and the the plus minus programme buttons .\nA : but also meant the the blinking li , the ones that also blink when you try to locate your remote .\nA : theys have to be .\nB : probably at the side .\nB : look at the front , but , exactly , and then there is .\nA : when you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that .\nA : and then you have strip of lights .\nB : something like that , .\nA : it's , for one thing .\nA : put something on top of it or , , like that's looks funny .\nA : or some bump .\nD : that'll be too big tha too big then .\nA : we'll have to think about it .\nA : we're we're done .\nD : yes , we are .\nA : we can save this one .\nD : yes , it's lunch time .\nD : half and hour ?\nD : our next next individual round was half an hour .\nA : that was what , we'll hear about it .\nD : about the lunch break ."], ["<t> The industrial designer talked about the options available for materials and components. </t>  <t> He suggested that the case should be

conceptual design meeting .\nA : i'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting .\nA : so , who wants to start off ?\nA : technical designer again ?\nA : before we begin it , want to say i've i've put the minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not quite .\nA : it it still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that were layered over each other .\nA : so but , from now on won't use my pen anymore , so will be just ordinary keyboard .\nB : may be better , .\nA : it will will be more easy for you to read the minutes .\nC : when we talk about components design , it's really about the material and the and really the we build the remote controls of .\nC : remote control consist of components and the components of remote control consist of properties and material .\nC : we have to choose these wisely and it could affect grow of in in buying the remote controls .\nC : the components of remote control are the case .\nC : the properties of the case , it has to be solid in hard material like hard plastic with soft rubber for falling and and , it feels good in your hand .\nC : the buttons has to be solid too , and the material is soft rubber .\nC : i've got email from the possibilities of real reaction .\nC : they're telling me that when we build remote control of of plastic or rubber , the buttons have to be rubber too .\nC : when we use rubbled doubled curved case , we must use rubber push-buttons to the the rubber double-curved case is is three-dimensional curve in the in the design , which is necessary when we want to be trendy .\nC : the energy source , i've got lot of possibilities for that too .\nC : the basic battery , which thi prefer because of its its non non-depending of of of here you have to have hand , kinetic energy .\nC : also in this one , like in the watches , but remote control can lie on table for day , and then you push button and so you don't have to walk with it all the all the time .\nC : solar cells are also bit weird for remote controls .\nC : also the case material , that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because wood or titanium would also be bit weird .\nB : titanium is probably trendy , .\nD : that's true , .\nB : little bit expensive .\nC : they don't tell anything about the cost of titanium .\nC : the chip the chip set and the board is all off the shelf .\nC : also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it .\nC : the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are just available in in our factory .\nC : i've told about the three first points .\nC : the simple electronical chip is is available with the led transmitter transmitter .\nC : it's all off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all available in our company .\nC : looked up on was the displays .\nC : could be something special to our remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost bit more , but it can be within the limits of twenty five euros .\nA : twelve and half .\nA : actually what are those , tooth brushes , or so but it's actually , it resembles the design had in mind for this proj the the cartoonish alessi design .\nC : got an email with some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one .\nC : you see covers , which can be , .\nB : different colours also .\nC : yes , we can bri bring couple of couple of types of whole whole set of different remote controls .\nA : and we can we can steal their ideas .\nC : we can bring whole line with with huge variety of house .\nA : it's possibility , too .\nC : like radios and television also in this in this in the same style , but yes , because we have to we have to we have to bring the logo and all the back into it .\nD : that'll be for the future , .\nA : next time we're here .\nB : shall go to the next slide .\nB : still don't have any information about user requirements .\nB : was thinking about just the basic functions and got , but but then wh when there are new user requirements .\nA : we decided upon that in the last meeting .\nB : ha ha have the have nothing .\nA : tha didn't receive any new requirements or someth no , but we decided to use only basic functions only .\nB : have here couple of basic functions could think of .\nB : if they're little bit more , but .\nA : we can think of that later .\nA : just these are the ones you already summed up in the .\nB : , pointed them out here , just to make it little bit easier .\nB : another function is we already discuss it on the side .\nB : what costs of it .\nB : i've no idea about it .\nB : was also looking for what you said , for got an email about in in in front of the remote control .\nB : if that's good idea , or it's little bit too much for twelve and half .\nB : if we got already something like base .\nA : that might get redundant also .\nA : what information it would .\nB : ju was just thinking about it .\nB : then got pop-ups to go to the meeting .\nC : we can bring teletext to the to the remote control .\nB : but the remote control .\nB : little too little bit little bit too big , .\nD : then you and then you've got flag very big r_c_ .\nA : that's not it was not good idea .\nB : the functions are are not more to discuss , .\nB : it's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no v_c_r_ or that , so that's very easy .\nA : but you do mention the next and previous button .\nD : next channel , previous channel .\nB : that's next channel .\nB : got an email with with an remote control with base .\nB : so , it's just an idea .\nB : and thinked of the button sizes and i'm not if they have to be big or just small , i'm not i'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness .\nC : but you're the expert .\nD : it depends on the function .\nB : it , that's your point .\nD : if you save perhaps tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that .\nB : i've nothing to , with little bit larger , .\nA : when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .\nB : so , but with the , that groups .\nA : we already upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , those two have , they have to be large .\nA : the the two two basic buttons , , the to skip channels and to , why , but that is that's trendy too , because that's the mo it it , it's acc acc accentu , how do you say it ?\nB : most the most used buttons .\nD : those are probably the the yes .\nA : it puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to to make these two most basic functions extra big , like .\nD : those are probably the four most most used buttons on the in the remote control .\nC : you did the research .\nA : and you want to acc accentuate that , .\nC : it's from your research .\nB : that was all personal preference didn't have .\nB : didn't had any time left .\nA : no , that's coo it's .\nD : you don't care .\nB : click on it .\nD : i've done some research again about trends on the internet .\nD : i've done some investigation , and got some information from fashion watchers from paris and milan .\nD : some some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control .\nD : , we were going to imply that , so that's .\nD : the second important thing is innovative technology in the r_c_ .\nD : our market really likes really likes that .\nD : and the third point there in this order if of importance , the third point , is high ease of use .\nD : and , , for the idea , i've put some trends for the market of elderly people .\nD : dark colours , simple recognisable shapes .\nD : so we probably won't do that .\nD : the younger market likes , the themes of of this year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material .\nD : found this image , which is , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables .\nD : don't see the spongy part in it .\nD : but with little bit of fancy exactly .\nA : then we have to do something with sponge bob then .\nD : got some ideas , , pictures isn't really good word , but some symbols of fruits or vegetables .\nD : fruit is yellow , green , red , whatever .\nD : so , remote controls in in catchy colours .\nA : it doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours .\nD : no , we don't want dark colours .\nA : not the dark colours ?\nD : no , put them there to , , for general idea .\nD : and , the docking st the spongy material is is very irritating for the remote control itself .\nD : but to , the to implement some spongy thing , we can do it in the in the docking station .\nD : at the bottom of the docking station or whatever .\nD : and , we could bring one line with dark colour to how do you say ?\nD : also bit for elderly people who are little bit crazy and want want little younger design but still the dark colour .\nA : no , but that our design already resembles so piece of fruit .\nB : how but how do we use fruits and vegetables in christ's sake with remote control ?\nD : it it it reaches different market , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to to bring like black r_c_ on the market or whatever .\nD : there's there's always there there's always empty space on remote control .\nB : make it banana ?\nA : it's like pear .\nD : this part of the r_c_ the upper the upper part or whatever is is not not used with buttons , .\nA : no , don't think you have to do it like , but it that doesn't have to remind you , , like explicitly of our of of specific piece of fruit , but just , , like the the the the round curves .\nD : so you you can put some fruity things no , not .\nA : and so this it already sem resembles something like pear to me .\nB : but , but that , but that's but don't we need creative artist like that to make it to feel like vegetable or fruit ?\nD : if we make it little bit greenish .\nA : you do get the idea , ?\nA : the fruity round .\nD : and we could use one of these for the what is it ?\nD : isn't wha whatever .\nA : we have we have very big the of design team , .\nD : we can we can we can produce multiple multiple things .\nC : for big team of artists .\nD : this is then the pear .\nD : the english word , so forget it .\nA : but it's pear , .\nD : and , , , banana is is not easy for remote control , but .\nC : but but we don't have to make we can't make all ten designs .\nC : we have to make one design .\nA : no , but it's it's already what we were were up to .\nD : mayb two or three .\nA : it's it doesn't have to resemble what already said , specific piece of fruit , but just , , like fruity thing going on .\nD : no , but but but that's , and and and what was what what was saying , the catchy colours .\nA : and it's it looks fruity to me .\nA : and , but do like the , do like the to the idea of making , catchy colour design and because do dark colour would be too .\nC : but pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables yes , you can put logo on top of it .\nA : it's too much , .\nB : but , we we have to there have to be the the the the firm colours , our own colours has to be in it .\nD : pictures was was bad word , but .\nA : but what are the this is yellow .\nB : yellow , real reaction .\nA : but don't think our our company colours are this fashionable .\nD : we can if if we got our docking station over here .\nC : yes , it's really fruity .\nB : we yellow do , .\nD : 't draw with this thing , but i'll try .\nD : if this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here .\nD : it doesn't work .\nD : and then , the button button over here or whatever , .\nB : and the button then .\nC : with strawberry on top .\nA : on on the bottom of the remote you can do .\nD : on the front , , because else you can't find it .\nD : that were my ideas little bit .\nD : i'll close down .\nA : you can you open the conceptual design presentation ?\nD : conceptual design , yes .\nA : see what was on the agenda .\nA : this is his own remote .\nA : because , we can start with the technical functions , but don't t's there , , do we want to use an display , ?\nC : only if we we can make t_v_ guide on it , for the channel you're on .\nD : but don't what to display on it .\nD : but it should be li like this big , and don't think yes , but it it has to to show an entire title of programme or at least quite quite large part of it and then you get very large screen , because , .\nA : but it's so don't think we should do it .\nC : no , no , only the t_v_ channel with the with with four programmes .\nC : you can zap through them with the page up page down button .\nC : yes , it can on your no , on your mobile phone you can you can read text also .\nC : so why not on your remote ?\nA : do it's bit redundant , actually .\nA : and it's also not don't even it looks like sexy , it's but you're already watching the t_v_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .\nB : ll what would you display on it then ?\nC : programme information or or or or or guide on on teletext , yes .\nB : but is it isn't that already on t_v_ , lot of new t_v_s ?\nD : but lot lot of t_v_s show when you zap to but then we also need to bring out line of t_v_s which we were planning to , but whatever .\nC : also on the internet .\nC : but yes , but you also want to 's next .\nB : and we also have to .\nD : because the t_v_ has to send information back to the r_c_ , and if that's possible .\nC : yes , that's really possible .\nD : yes , yes , it's possible , but you gotta implement it in the t_v_s , and don't think everyone's gonna buy real reaction t_v_ within month after the release of our remote control .\nB : and also , .\nA : really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an in it , but really don't t's good goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted when we talk about the materials , it's good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber on it .\nA : it was our idea , , to give it more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it .\nA : but don't think display fits in that image .\nA : it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , .\nD : that's true , that's true , it breaks , it it it's not very solid , it's frag fragile .\nA : you could make it , but it's just it it doesn't don't it's coherent with the design we're after .\nD : don't ei either .\nA : but that's my opinion .\nA : you you , we can vote for it .\nA : you want the display .\nA : don't want to and he doesn't , so it's up to him .\nA : if we wanna and i've read somewhere that i've got some veto veto rights .\nA : so also say but did we skip the , you could do but what what so what but do you think we should we're not even what what information we want to display on it .\nB : we can you away .\nB : if it's it's simple no , that , and also have to think about new functions , buttons like that to control it .\nC : no yes , you can use buttons that are already on the remote control for double functions .\nA : so nah , that's not gonna work .\nB : or but how does it display then ?\nB : when go to the second channel , what what does it show me ?\nC : then you push button .\nC : the title and the information about the programme .\nB : about that programme ?\nC : but but , what he said was , about the televisions , they have to be customised to the but in future it will be giant hit , and when you are the first you have the biggest yes , you can put little display on it with with lots of information .\nA : i've seen it done before .\nA : do like the the bigger rem universal remotes , they have displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what device you are controlling .\nA : so it's that that's what i've seen .\nD : that's true , if you .\nA : but it just it it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept .\nC : but haven't thought about it .\nC : but whe but when you put transparent plastic screen on top of it , it it isn't vulnerable .\nC : you can throw with it and when when you put colour screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have remote control from but i've got the email with with the possibilities .\nA : that's not the most important , but it's just don't .\nB : is it fashion ?\nB : that's not up to you .\nB : that's up to market if if it's trendy .\nA : do you ha do you have to you haven't looked after the trendiness of displays , have you ?\nB : because our our motto is we put fashion , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured .\nD : it's it's pretty trendy , to be honest , but if if if , i'm coming back to the costs again , but we gotta build pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits .\nD : and especially colour , which is pretty trendy .\nD : but don't think , it will be too expensive .\nC : and was possibility for the remote control .\nC : so why don't we use it .\nD : did it say price also for for monogramme or coloured ?\nA : but we're gonna if it then then you better don't , really don't feel the whole idea of an display .\nB : coloured if you have black and white , or grey , that's it's too much with with the and the docking station and with one thing special .\nD : really , if if you in in two thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is monogramme .\nC : no , but it doesn't sa say anything about colour or but , , alf also got possibility to put scroll button on it .\nC : but didn't think that yes , but on the no , when but it look yes , but that remote controls are already on the market .\nA : it can't co you cannot convince me .\nA : how how to with you , but don't really feel it .\nA : we already we're , we already have the the base station gadgets , and want and it , do it has to be simple design , which sturdy , which soft don't , and really , don't see how the the display is gonna add anything , , on design level .\nD : we've we've gotta find balance , .\nD : and we have pear .\nB : not whole package of specialty .\nA : it's slicker to have no l_ ceds .\nA : we want to it's simplicity , you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an .\nA : it doesn't fit in our philosophy behind the whole remote .\nC : the simple yes , but but when you want to have something special yes , but you had picture of it from another company .\nA : but we already have the docking station , which is it has to be developed , but no , but it that's that's our that's our killer feature .\nB : it's just an it's just an idea .\nA : that's our what makes it special .\nB : it's it's true .\nC : yes , it was already made .\nC : tha the remote control on the docking station .\nA : we're gonna develop our own docking station .\nD : is that so ?\nD : was it it wasn't just prototype ?\nC : yes , he have picture of it .\nD : exactly , i've never seen it in store .\nA : but re we really have to cut this off , re know you get the idea you really like it , , the the thing , but it's it's not good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments .\nA : don't , do you agre how do you think ?\nA : we skip the display .\nB : no , it's too much .\nD : it's little too much , .\nA : i'm , you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement .\nC : mayb will rule the world with it .\nA : but probably so .\nA : but for the technical part .\nA : the material , it was good idea to use the plastic and the rubber .\nC : yes , bit of cushion is yes .\nA : this is what it , but it it was already what we're we're after , , to give it , , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like , that is the airbag thing .\nD : for the spongy feel .\nB : with spongy bob feel .\nA : you can st throw it at your little brother's head .\nB : you just can drop it .\nD : if you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , .\nA : no no no , not that comfy .\nC : it but then we have to look that it will not be too childish to see .\nA : that's that's good point .\nA : and that's why like the dark col dark colour bit , , because it may be the design , it's it is bit of the it's bit nineties , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point .\nB : but not black .\nB : if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful .\nA : that's that's true , but but it has to be little big solid .\nD : , that's what was pointing at .\nB : but can we ge can we combine it ?\nA : it mustn't be too , , too overwhelming , then when you put it on your just .\nB : with yellow and black ?\nB : make it bee ?\nA : no , don't like the yellow and black combination .\nA : but it is our company colours .\nC : yes , real real good colours .\nB : we we have to use yellow .\nA : don't like yellow , and .\nD : we can as as draw really nicely over there .\nC : but that's not really fruity .\nD : we can put the logo on our on our base station .\nD : and very very tiny on the remote control itself .\nA : but , but what , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ?\nC : fronts of the we can have different fronts of the telephone .\nA : should we do that ?\nA : don't think you we should do that .\nA : just bring it out in different colours , but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much .\nD : that's that's enough .\nA : people don't wanna spend more money on their remote control , .\nD : that's way too nokia .\nB : you can you can let choose the customer which colour he wants , .\nC : are these designs ?\nB : three three or four four colours , like that .\nD : just bring more designs on the market .\nA : but , without gon .\nD : why not , .\nA : so , are we through the technical part then ?\nA : so we upon , not unanimously or how you call it , but .\nC : it this real young young and dynamic styles .\nB : , the three to one .\nB : that's and tita titanium , is is is it no ?\nA : the materials you mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite .\nA : only only the last point your no titanium's not not out of question , .\nC : yes , but also yes , bu but when we use soft .\nB : is it's just like that , this titanium .\nA : but is it possible to use both the the plastic and so soft things and titanium , as ?\nA : makes it in homogeneous design .\nB : no , not all , not all of them .\nC : but it it then it you can't throw it it .\nC : it will make huge noise or break other when you throw with titanium with your remote control .\nA : it will it will break other when it's plastic , as .\nC : no , titanium is bit it's bit harder .\nA : no , but , you should ma .\nC : but also on the colours , the young yes , but titanium remote control , when you're watching t_v_ or your hands are little bit sweaty , and the yes .\nA : think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium .\nA : would it be more trendy ?\nD : it it does .\nB : titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic .\nB : in trendy things .\nD : on the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity with , that's true , that's true .\nB : it's cold in the winter .\nA : but really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big thing .\nA : but the question is then it's , , is is it fits in our philosophy to make it sturdy and simple and , know , like when you make it titanium , it becomes more like some gadget you actually don't need .\nC : sports and gaming .\nA : and when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun you can always have around .\nA : it's always fun to have something big and plastic around .\nB : you have that m_p_ three player of nike , saw .\nB : isn't that titanium with little bit of rubber ?\nC : yes , it's but it is plastic .\nB : isn't it is plastic ?\nB : it's titanium looking .\nC : yes , we can do that on the on the we can make this as style too .\nB : here he is .\nB : the if the m_p_ three player of nike .\nB : that that's very with rubber , so it's very rough .\nD : but but but , that's difficult , because that's different material , and then you gotta have like two material lines of of of , if it's just colour which you which you change then , it's it's to have one of these .\nC : this is just no , we we can make it from the same plastic .\nA : this is an no , do like the idea of titanium kind type of body and then with plastic colouration around it .\nC : don't have the information .\nA : like the the soft , but if it's possible .\nC : didn't got it yes .\nA : but you can't make the plastic give the ti titanium look .\nA : but make it just like shiny .\nA : we should shou and and we sh should we if we should talk about , how how much time have we got left ?\nC : like the m_p_ three player .\nB : that's good idea , .\nB : but if you want to la , last longer than two weeks like that , you can .\nC : in lot of other in lot of other product categories like even in in bags industry .\nB : what time does the rubber .\nC : they began with typical leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all colours , and fon of of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it like eastpack began revolution with it with all this bags and and colours and and yes , and and styles .\nA : you putting in different colours .\nC : they have also roses on it , and then we can always use the same design for greater resemblance , but with new with new colours , new yes .\nA : but , let's think about the bas , .\nD : new prints on it .\nA : but wha our basic idea , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the the plastic enclosure and then the the pads that surround it .\nA : and and pro and lights .\nA : we have to incorporate the lights too .\nA : but , do gonna gonna are we going to give it two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the the cushion pads around it are in another colour ?\nA : is that the idea ?\nA : is that good idea ?\nD : how do you mean ?\nD : the base in in another yes .\nA : how many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're only five minutes left , by the way .\nA : how many colours are we gonna give it ?\nA : like two-tone colour ?\nC : there there are three components three components type .\nA : the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as should be in another colour .\nB : no , not too much .\nC : you have the buttons , the the case itself , and the rubber and yes .\nD : how the buttons .\nB : or you just make one colour , with like big wave like in in another colour .\nA : but not more than , , it's no .\nB : not more than two colours .\nD : no , definitely not .\nB : it's little bit too flashy .\nA : we should talk about it on in later meeting .\nD : yes , definitely .\nC : or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as but then you have to put up and down and left and .\nA : but we have to think of some other important things .\nA : the the functionalities of the the buttons .\nB : the funct , was was thinking about the st do we still want joystick idea .\nD : no , that's too vulnerable .\nA : this is , the so we have the basic .\nA : then we have the numbers .\nA : we have the power button .\nA : we have we have teletext button .\nB : the volume , teletext and , , but wha what menu ?\nA : and want to access menu .\nD : but that's that's was thinking that's gotta be on the television .\nA : most t_v_s have menu .\nA : but you ha really need menu button .\nA : that's just the only button only , no , most t_v_s have an menu nowadays to access the screen settings .\nB : is isn't that different from every television ?\nD : if it's if , it's to to add menu button for and if the t_v_ doesn't have menu , then .\nA : and so but that that covers all the all the other settings .\nA : it covers everything then .\nD : you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever .\nA : no , you can use the and you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that .\nA : in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then ten rem , mute .\nD : mute and teletext and menu .\nA : teletext and menu , and then then that's it .\nA : it's all we need .\nA : another stuf some about the the the design of the docking station .\nB : that's not mu not much functions .\nA : something important about , no , which sh should remind us of the remote itself , .\nA : in one colour .\nD : are we gonna do something with the spongy thing there ?\nA : just use the spongy thing already comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the side .\nC : what are we going to do now ?\nD : that's true , that's true .\nA : and we will make it spongy and and and , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru did this is fruity , .\nA : just round shapes with , but we're gonna have to we really have to think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy .\nD : it's kinda fruity , and with with catchy colours , definitely .\nA : it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to still have to think of how we manage to to get to that .\nA : we're through then .\nA : but we also we just so we have to do something with colour but also , we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind .\nA : that's adds to the too much colour but our des design experts will work that out .\nB : too much colour , it when you got it in living room , it's too much .\nB : it has to be .\nA : the meeting will be over within minute .\nA : so we will wrap up .\nD : something like that .\nA : or is there anything we'd like to discuss ?\nD : do you , ?\nA : you will read the minutes in the you can find them in the pro probably .\nD : in the shared folder .\nA : no , for su for because i'm will now type them out .\nD : you'll see in you email , .\nA : but toilet paper roll and .\nB : and the other thing is that you don't have prototype like that .\nB : you see kinda prototype you can little bit more .\nC : will make one in the next twenty minutes .\nD : construct one , .\nB : with you laptop ?\nD : alright , shall we get back to work ?\nA : was waiting for the last message , but .\nC : back to the pen ."],

.\nA : we're gonna have prototype presentation first .\nA : who's gonna give the prototype presentation ?\nC : we've made prototype .\nC : we've got our aspects from the last meeting .\nC : especially we looked at the form , material and the colour .\nC : we've drawn here the prototype .\nC : the logo is is is pretty obvious to see on the on the remote control , but it is necessary when you want to build your company to level higher .\nC : our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing .\nC : you can point them the functions .\nB : the all the functions are discussed the most of the functions are obvious .\nB : it's little bit .\nB : then the the the nine channels .\nB : the volume at the side , and the other side is the programmes .\nB : and then we had just two buttons , we place them in the middle , the menu , and for the teletext that was , the mute button .\nA : no , the the the mute button misses now .\nA : do do you did we want to have mute button ?\nC : but that it's here then , in the middle .\nD : alright , and you gotta point out which is the volume button and which is the programme button .\nC : yes , we've disc most of the users yes , there there will be little little p_ on that and little .\nB : mo mo , most of them are right-handed .\nD : but you you gotta make it clear on the on , and and triangle on that .\nB : don't have time in anymore on the , just progr programme above , .\nD : next to that kinda miss zero actually .\nA : there's was one thing wanted to ask .\nA : there are different ways for remote controls to do like call it teens and twenties .\nA : the two numbers .\nD : all no , that's kinda dependent on the television .\nA : but do we have do we need extra buttons , some some have to , but you don't you don't actually need them , becau lot of remote controls work that when that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have couple of seconds no , don't .\nD : you should add cross , or whatever .\nC : yes , yes , you have you have lot of standard buttons that has to be on it , with the one and double yes .\nB : and then second .\nD : no , that's dependent on the television .\nC : yes , you have televisions , then you have to , , you have to press yes , but but lot yes , but some televisions don't accept that that no , no , but yes , but some some old televisions you have to click on special button , then you go to next level , you can push two buttons .\nD : do know so .\nB : is it depending on television ?\nA : nah , don't really , because you have know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , you can still select the twenty number in the twenty or in the ten .\nD : yes , but no remote control nowadays are they come with the television .\nD : or actually , the other way around .\nA : no , really t's because you can when when you put button on it with like one and then dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , because it it first gives you the functionality of that that separate button you also had to apply .\nD : but su if no no no .\nA : because that's it's for television .\nA : it's exact the same thing .\nD : so some television respond differently .\nD : look , if yes .\nA : no , listen listen .\nA : when you push the button , the remote control gives signal .\nA : in in the first place it gives signal which it would also send when you put separate button on it .\nD : yes , that's true .\nA : the one with dash , that signal gi and when whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives signal for channel one .\nD : no no , it it it works if you haven't got special button for it , if you push one , then on your television there will appear one and line , which is an empty space .\nA : it works that way , really .\nA : but it's exact the same that would appear when you put separate button push separate button .\nA : but you don't underst you don't understand my point .\nA : it's exact the same thing when no , but then they would would also support that button , because it's the same thing .\nC : you want yes , but some television don't support it .\nB : but the ex .\nA : listen , with that that's that special but button you're talking about , ?\nA : that's just signal to recei ju they send signal to the tv t_v_ that they have to put one in on your screen and dash , which you can pu so you can still put another number on it .\nA : when you don't have that separate button , and you push one , it's exactly the same thing .\nA : do you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had .\nD : no , some some televisions need the input first and and you no , that's not true .\nC : no , remote can yes , so they need no , they need no , but , it and the button for the scart audio video external input .\nA : but you give the input .\nA : you push the one .\nA : that's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is .\nD : it's simply not true .\nA : think about it .\nD : it's simply not true .\nB : you you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly one and just dash , and then two seconds we'll discuss them in the usability lab .\nD : no , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds .\nA : and it's the same thing what happens and remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one .\nD : remote control is stupid thing .\nD : if you push button , it sends it immediately to to the television .\nA : but but it's know for that some televisions that the remote control supplied , only ha has the these buttons with one and dash and two and dash , but when you use bu remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works .\nA : but , we we'll impl no , we'll apply them then for now .\nD : no , definitely not .\nB : if if it's it's necessary .\nA : app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two .\nA : for now , if we for whether but .\nD : you can access that via zero , and then minus , .\nA : what said about the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , but still it it all t_v_s in some ways support it , .\nC : no , no .\nA : it's more is we don't we both don't really understand how it how it really works , but there's more to in than wha than what you just said .\nC : remote control sends one signal at one button press .\nA : do think that t_v_s support mur multiple remote controls .\nC : some some televisions when when you want to go further than ten no , you have to you have to give the television two or more signals .\nA : won't work wi with to have that special button .\nC : when you press one button , you give one signal .\nC : and the older televisions need more signals to go level higher .\nC : but when you make the technology that that it will give more signals , it could work , but just basic idea of of of the most most most common and simple operations on the remote .\nD : kinda miss the docking station .\nC : it's here on the we came yes .\nB : there's nothing it's pretty basic , the the there's no fu there's one there's one button , that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's the one button when you want to find it .\nD : no nothing really trendy about it .\nC : but we can we can make the docking station bit standard for for the other products we sell , because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls .\nC : so we can use the docking station , , m_p_ three players or or hearing devices .\nD : that's very difficult , because of different shapes of devices .\nC : yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put when the when the when the the the lowest part of it , when it's the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same yes , but we can make no , we can make make the most lowest part all the same .\nD : it got it it has got to fit into the shape , .\nD : the technology and the voltage can be the same .\nD : that's that's true .\nD : but if you all make the having bottom like this , then they all fit .\nD : that's true , but yes , but shouldn't it fall then ?\nC : when when the the recharger has has bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .\nC : just have to be big enough for the biggest no , when you make it large enough no it it will not .\nD : it isn't going to fall down ?\nD : that's bit , no , but if if like this , i'll i'll point it out , if you got base base like this , won't draw it really .\nC : but then it's little bit but it's just an idea .\nD : if you got base which is as big as this , but if you got if you got tiny player , it can .\nC : but it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can make all the products as flat as this .\nB : but it's backwards .\nC : yes , but when you make bit of big yes , little holer littler , little products go deeper in it .\nB : but it's it's backwards .\nB : it's leaning backwards , , in the in the docking station .\nD : wha what you could do if you from the bottom , , help .\nA : but let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because we have we have to consider the docking station anyway , because we have some cost issues still to come .\nD : you could make like hole in it , , of in in the .\nD : that that is possible , .\nC : and the the look and feel would be on this remote control , because you always will pick up the remote control in the in the smallest area .\nA : but we have to look .\nD : don't like the colours .\nC : then your left thumb of your thumb is near the programme button , which is the most common used function , and all the other buttons are available for your thumb .\nC : so it's it's it's really good design .\nC : yes , on the side there will be strip of rubber , and in the middle there is hard hard material , bit hard plastic with light behind it .\nD : and other lights ?\nA : added lights are gonna be problem too .\nC : yes , we can make also neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make light on it .\nD : no , on the on the front .\nD : the the logo .\nC : but , it will also use batteries , and do we want to the all the aspects of the interface buttons were yes .\nA : for now , this is is good enough .\nA : what was on the , but in the , the colour , because we're gonna use one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ?\nA : then we're gonna do the buttons in the are we're gonna have rubber buttons .\nA : and they're be they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side .\nD : in the same colour as the side .\nD : that'll be good .\nA : and we should use darker colour for the plastic , and some more brighter and flashy , we'll talk about the lights later .\nC : yes , we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use multiple lights , so it will yes .\nA : 'cause also don , it's depends on the costs and such .\nA : but , and we have to agree upon the exact colours , but may if that's important , but we'll talk about that later .\nA : for now this is this is .\nA : the next you gonna give presentation too ?\nA : have to see the agenda .\nD : , i'm gonna do something there , .\nD : we gotta do that on the the most right-most screen , because the leftmost , that's me .\nD : will be needing that image , so leave it .\nD : we're gonna evaluate that design according to few points .\nD : we the four of us are going to do that together .\nD : wanna have colour over here , come on .\nD : the remote is not ugly , bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so said not ugly instead of ugly .\nD : what would you say , we we gotta give points to to all of these to evaluate that design , and forget the drawing skills of these .\nD : the remote control is not ugly .\nD : how do you feel ?\nA : four would be appropriate , because it's , it really depends on taste .\nA : it's , our design .\nA : it's so if lot of people find it really ugly , , other people find it really .\nA : or how you casting .\nD : how do you feel ?\nC : the the fronts will give it more less uglier side , because you can make it in your own yes , you can make it in your own more to your own personality or or house style .\nD : the different designs .\nA : but we we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts , believe .\nD : no , not not fronts , but different designs .\nA : with colour co colours .\nB : no , not fronts .\nD : and that's still , , is is is little personal touch , .\nB : different colours , .\nA : but , we should do three that , our .\nD : wha wha what would you think ?\nB : we can make it one .\nD : yes , but what is it ?\nC : two or three .\nD : two or three .\nB : go for the positive .\nD : was was thinking about three , so three is bit , what am doing ?\nB : so go for two .\nA : was thinking about four , so three is , let that let's make that one .\nD : i'll mark it .\nD : the remote control's that makes zapping easy .\nD : antek , you agree ?\nB : i'll i'll agree .\nA : that's one thing for .\nD : you're not antek .\nB : i'm the i'm the usability , so .\nD : the remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible .\nA : two or one , .\nB : the , menu , .\nA : it's something we really put work into .\nD : would say one because every button is relevant .\nC : it's all about the buttons .\nD : and our , it's .\nD : the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .\nD : we succeeded there .\nA : but two , because of the menu button .\nA : and telete , we if the they're necessary .\nC : also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , they're used can yes , three , two .\nD : the the , , you you've got point .\nA : came long way , but not we didn't not no , it can also always be more simplistic , but two is .\nD : two or three ?\nC : but you can't make remote control without them , because yes .\nB : because we got .\nD : nay that that that's true , that's true .\nD : they're definitely needed .\nD : so we put it on two ?\nD : the remote control has got really trendy look .\nA : it's hard to say from this picture .\nC : we we've tried to make it the the best trendy look ever .\nA : but do t's more but do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .\nB : will will make it three , because .\nA : so so it has to score higher on this than on the three .\nD : was planning to give it two , where give the not ugly , , that's true .\nD : you agree on the two ?\nA : when you compare to the what's the difference with .\nD : remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .\nD : copied that one .\nD : remote control has got innovative technology implanted .\nB : we're not , the the the on the side .\nC : no , not , so .\nA : but we you mean the rubber ?\nD : and the light .\nA : but we have we have to talk about the lights .\nB : and the light .\nC : but that that's not innovative .\nB : but , six .\nA : and don't also it's also really not innovative , it's more no , six .\nD : it's not seven ?\nC : lights lights are six .\nA : or seven , .\nB : no , six .\nD : why why not seven ?\nA : mine is seven .\nC : because we've tried to make it little bit innovative , but it but it with the lights it it's it's future but still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with yes .\nA : it's depends on the on the no , actually it's seven , but there's nothing innovative about it .\nD : you think the lights are innovative ?\nD : agree , but i'll , you you didn't draw the docking station .\nB : innovative in generally or just original for docking station is innova .\nA : no no , .\nD : it it's with its more that that's no , , the agenda says evaluate now , so we it's it's six .\nC : the docking station is is little bit innovative .\nA : the dock station , but but , the the docking station , it's gonna be problem .\nC : it's part of the remote .\nC : and with the speaker on the there's also speaker .\nA : but , let's leave it open for for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway .\nA : for now it's six or seven , sev six , because , but don't if it's very inno .\nC : but the retrieval or the yes , how would you innovate remote control more ?\nD : that , for the retrieval function .\nD : that's very innovative for remote control .\nA : , more through like function t_v_ functionalities and no no , what .\nC : to put it on your head .\nA : you have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control , not in how you find your .\nD : but but definitely don't t's five , but remote control is easy to use .\nA : it's that's that's think about it la later on and , as one or two ma at least .\nD : the remote control hasn't got .\nA : no , would have seen that one before .\nA : you skipped one , here .\nD : i've just filled go away .\nC : you like the buttons .\nD : found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten .\nA : remote control will be bought by .\nD : it will be bought by people under the age of forty .\nC : in in and comparing with people of of the age above ?\nA : just in general .\nD : no no no .\nD : no , just if they if they buy it .\nC : but yes , two , but only in when you compare it with with elderly .\nD : what do you think ?\nA : that is not the question .\nD : no , that's no comparison .\nA : it's just it will be bought by people under forty .\nA : you can , you can be very picky about it .\nD : and don't mean two people .\nC : this is just guessing .\nA : just make it we'll make it two .\nC : make it two .\nD : the rem the remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan .\nC : when it succeeds , it can get two , mu logo .\nA : you have make an slogan is quite obvious .\nB : we don't have the slogan though .\nA : the , no , not not the slogan .\nD : can we see the slogan ?\nA : you can put that on the side if if we would like to .\nC : yes , encrypted with yes .\nA : and will still t's gonna be two or three .\nD : are we gonna do that ?\nA : three this time .\nD : because of the slogan remote control's got basic design intended for novice users .\nA : and , it's one or two .\nA : make it two .\nD : we gotta add up the scores now to see our total average .\nD : four , five , seven , nine .\nD : fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six .\nD : it's two point six .\nA : it's not that bad .\nD : alright , we .\nA : and that's mostly the inno when we score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , which is quite score .\nA : this is was the evaluation ?\nD : this was my evaluation .\nA : because still think that the most important part of this meeting still has .\nD : so we did pretty job until now .\nD : is this your whatever .\nC : is there something after this meeting ?\nD : we gotta fill out another questionnaire .\nA : still opened or .\nA : because received spreadsheet .\nA : but actually don't need this presentation , .\nA : i'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because didn't really fin have .\nA : didn't really finish it .\nA : we we'll see .\nA : we'll stumble upon some problems .\nD : we probably will .\nA : probably have already opened it here .\nA : try it again .\nA : first of all , the all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list .\nA : but let's let's st start with beginning .\nA : we include one battery .\nA : i'll explain its , the the components are listed over here .\nA : price is given .\nA : we , we we indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them .\nD : the amount , .\nA : and then , we'll calcula don't watch the number yet .\nA : if it's filled in properly .\nA : we need one battery .\nA : one battery is enough .\nA : we don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo .\nA : this this is first problem .\nA : we should know how many simple chips , regular chips .\nC : it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it .\nA : but where did we find this information ?\nC : the simple chip is enough , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be no , yes , my my my the the email got said simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever device , it will cost bit more , like the advanced chip .\nD : haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really .\nA : was it it was your job in the first meet , your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some time problems .\nA : but do you you do what chip we need ?\nD : and how do ?\nD : you got that email .\nC : bec no , the they didn't know about retriever or speaker in it .\nD : did it point out what to use them for ?\nA : you can look it up now .\nA : when we don't when we leave the retriever and such aside , what then it would be simple chip .\nC : then it's simple chip .\nA : and with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip .\nC : yes , that will be enough for future recommendations .\nD : alright , , point out the advanced chip for now , .\nA : but it will it will it will be lot of problems .\nA : the sample sensor sample speaker .\nA : what is it is that the speaker we were what it is .\nA : we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber .\nA : and with special colour .\nA : that's what we were , about the special colour , but , we we have special colours .\nC : otherwise , you get standard plastic colour .\nD : if it's very special .\nD : alright , that's .\nA : then the push-button , was just counting them .\nA : you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ?\nB : whoa , it's little that's huge .\nA : that's bit of problem , because re but really don't understand that , because imagine remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet .\nB : we have the simplest buttons .\nC : no , it's only when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much .\nD : don't , because it says amount .\nC : if you use scroll-wheel it's the push-buttons .\nA : it wouldn't fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost .\nD : the the the yellow row is the amount of to that's total of four buttons .\nA : and count them like this .\nC : you can have four push-buttons .\nB : one til nine .\nC : you can have different , yes .\nB : is that one or is that nine buttons ?\nA : one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen .\nA : because , this is , this is one , .\nA : twelve , , then it would be eighteen , because , rated them as as separate buttons .\nA : and plus these two , plus the mute button , and it's will be eighteen .\nD : one two three four five , si fifty cents for one single stupid button .\nC : why is that so expensive .\nA : do don't get the point , because it's would be relatively so expensive , just these small buttons .\nB : is it cents , the the the fifty cents button ?\nC : so , whe when you so then it it's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of when you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton .\nA : , ll let's make it just one .\nA : here , now it's now it's already shall we just give our own interpretation to , because else we would really have problem .\nA : it would be impossible to make it and and less buttons than this isn't possible .\nD : 't couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per per button .\nB : it's way no , no no .\nD : , no , really .\nC : and then throw it but whe i've seen one one remote control with only the pu , only with page up , page down and volume , but but , it's it's still for little children .\nA : this is the most simple , it is possible , but i've never seen one before .\nA : without the numbers .\nB : that's still four .\nA : we could skip the numbers .\nD : but wouldn't want to own that .\nC : they can handle that remote control , but but it isn't fo yes , it's for it's li it's just for little otherwise , it otherwise it would be the special form also , it says .\nA : then , teletext would also be im impossible .\nB : that's no option , that's no option .\nA : we'll we'll just .\nA : but then still , when we there's no room for docking station .\nA : tha le let's see we have , button supplements .\nA : we'll give the buttons special colour .\nA : we'll give them special form .\nA : we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , .\nB : special colour , why special colour ?\nA : because the buttons will be will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings .\nB : but wha what what special ?\nA : that's the what they mean by special colour .\nD : don't think the special form is really true .\nA : all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it , special material also , because has rubber .\nA : and the buttons have to be rubber .\nC : what is the normal material ?\nA : but the problem now is that the there's no such thing as docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make docking station for thirty cents .\nC : but we can sell the remote control and sell the docking station yes .\nB : se no no no .\nC : and and but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of can almost make it impossible to buy remote control without the docking station .\nA : but do like the idea , but we .\nA : it but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we need .\nC : no , but you otherwise you can't retrieve it .\nD : really don't get it .\nD : if it's simple chip , then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents .\nA : we can agree on this .\nA : the special colour thing has to be marked .\nA : 'cause we , that's what what what they mean but can we find out about this chips ?\nC : but for two euros and thirty cents , we we don't get docking station .\nD : so , too .\nA : because when we don't need docking station , then probably we also have only we also need simple chip .\nB : and then we can get docking station .\nA : and then we can do something extra .\nC : for for two euros .\nA : , still , it's gonna get more expensive with .\nA : then we have some money left .\nA : we can put then we can put scroll-wheel on it .\nD : if you if it would cost two euros , that had total total thing , it would be too , we're not gonna add trip to hawaii to it .\nA : or little bit of tin titanium .\nB : but what what can we do but what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with regular chip and advanced chip ?\nA : or we can ki do the kinetic cells .\nA : that's also an idea .\nA : that's what then what he has to find out .\nA : you can find it in your email now , then we know then we exactly it will cost us .\nB : if if regular chip and because we don't have special functions to use in advanced chip , .\nA : is that that's to know .\nA : bu bu but when we , but when we skip when we when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still , we need something else to make it special , because that was our our special feature .\nD : like the hand dynamo part .\nD : we can make plain docking station for two euros .\nB : we'll go back tomorrow .\nD : wi wi without recharge , but but we can make docking station for two euros if you don't put the recharge function in it .\nA : , you can also do that , but it still is special remote control cons , wi its form is special and material .\nD : it has shape .\nA : but for two euros , then we have still we have to use the advanced chip , then two euros isn't even possible .\nD : it has shape , but why should that not be possible ?\nA : then because then we'd thirty cents left .\nD : no , for for the for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip .\nA : but , , because , we have to find out with the simple chip .\nB : that's the question .\nB : if we do do we need an advanced chip , or is it no .\nA : and and and we need and what is this ?\nC : it isn't in my information , so it either .\nA : sample sensor sample speaker .\nC : it isn't in my information , i've got schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about advanced chips or i've got here in will put will put page on it .\nA : you can look at it for presentation .\nB : no no , they were mine , .\nC : when my mouse works again .\nC : my mouse is yes .\nC : i've got it .\nC : will put my email on the the network .\nD : what the hell are these ?\nC : it's on it .\nA : don't think here it's in here already .\nB : it's circuit board .\nB : it's only just basics for for at the end circuit there is an infrared led .\nA : it's nothing about .\nD : this isn't helpful .\nA : but in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components .\nA : which one was it ?\nC : yes , that was mine .\nD : no , that was my presentation .\nA : yes , it was the second one .\nC : but that was my second but this is the same this is only the possibilities .\nA : it was your second your first presentation .\nD : it's already open .\nD : it's at the bottom .\nD : it's at your task bar .\nB : but it's the the other one .\nA : this is this is not this that's not the one .\nB : was it working design or components design ?\nA : no , this is the other one .\nA : or something is there's something abo in in these here .\nC : we can use simple , regular , or advanced chip .\nB : the display requires an advanced chip .\nD : it doesn't say anything .\nA : that push-button requires simple chip , but scroll-wheel , it it me requires , so we only need simple chip .\nC : with the light .\nB : but that that's just the same as the the led .\nA : no no , that's just simple chip .\nD : that's not needed .\nA : scroll-wheel it only states that scroll-wheel requires regular chip , and that display requires an advanced chip .\nA : so , we don't need any of them .\nD : display is , , for showing letters .\nD : for showing text .\nD : don't think that just little light , agree .\nB : the normal simple chip will be .\nA : and what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ?\nC : you can say against the remote page page up , page down .\nB : that's not too what we want .\nD : we might want it , but .\nC : all in twelve euros .\nA : back to the costs .\nC : twelve euros and fifty cents .\nA : so we're gonna use the simple chip .\nB : so , simple chip is .\nC : and the lights .\nC : where are the lights ?\nB : lights , , there's no category .\nD : there're three , .\nA : nah , there is some money left to be spent .\nB : can we do it wi within two two euro ?\nD : we can make docking station .\nA : but what we have to think about now is that is is it still special remote control ?\nA : but it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any innovated innovative te technology anyway , .\nA : don't don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy .\nB : but it's original .\nA : but what is there some extra the kinetic thing is something .\nD : no , that's true .\nA : instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to know , so so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore .\nD : bu or the hand dynamo dynamo .\nA : we if we put the kinetic thing in it , you leave the , know , but still they will think about that .\nC : but but sometimes you put kinetics aren't nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking .\nA : if you the it's made for people , the they don't if it was useless technology , they wouldn't put it as possibility .\nC : solar cells are useless .\nA : and it it the the target the target group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as matter of speaking .\nA : because it when when there was remote control where it was useful to have kinetic power source , then it would be this one .\nA : because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around lot and it gets used lot that that's that's thing about it , .\nD : but but if we ca if five minutes .\nA : you don't use batteries .\nA : i've never seen it before in remote control .\nB : but then we could make docking station .\nA : no , we we we can't make docking station anyway .\nD : that's not true .\nA : we can als or also we we can make one we can still make , but be serious , then the docking station will be fifth of the price of the remote control .\nD : we can make docking station for two thirty .\nB : why no li look at now , we got two two thirty left .\nC : fo for docking station .\nD : we can make docking station .\nB : ca can't we make docking station of that ?\nC : with cable , with buttons on it , with retrieval device in it .\nD : the power device is is is very cheap .\nD : that's just regular power cable and whatever .\nC : wi with button to wi with button to retrieve it , so it will beep .\nB : we we , then we don't have any innovation things .\nC : so it's wireless technology .\nA : but we we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other .\nA : don't t's realistic for you to do so .\nD : then it's useless project .\nC : look at the case , the case the case of of of no , then we have to sell it for thirty euros .\nA : because we we look the special we have .\nA : colour the colours are special , the form is special .\nA : it this is whole concept .\nA : it with the kinetic thing , we could do do compromise with the kim kinetic thing .\nD : can't we can't we say fifteen euros ?\nD : no , sta no .\nB : no , we only make less profit of it .\nC : it's the we can can do it both .\nD : you can sell for twenty seven and half .\nD : then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and half production costs .\nA : don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it like still fee also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the , it it gives something dynamic to the remote control .\nD : don't think no .\nC : we can do it both in the in the in the remote .\nC : battery and kinetic .\nA : no , that wouldn't no .\nA : and it is also not good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore .\nD : and only , but only kinetic , then you gotta you you gotta throw throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really .\nC : yes , but when it's then when it then you have to shake it and all when it's when it's empty .\nA : no no no .\nA : no no , this is very sophisticated technology technology .\nA : when you use it your remote like once day , or even less it it we can make it no .\nC : you asked for three no , that's that's not true .\nC : watch is kinetic because you walk all the time .\nA : becau be but remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it , but calculator also works on on solar cells .\nC : yes , solar cells are also stated .\nC : why don't we use solar cells then ?\nA : because the whole dynamic part , do , appeals to me qui thinking of our design philosophy , , with the rubber parts and sturdiness of the thing , and when you move it around lot , then people find the idea funny that when move my remote control around and , but you don't have to .\nD : it's funny for week .\nD : something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating .\nA : the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens .\nD : no , don't move my my remote control very much , .\nA : then we , we don't have to do it , but what that would just have lack of key features , .\nA : you have to put something on your box .\nA : you have to make people buy it and we can really can do the docking thing , it's not , we can do it , but it's would be easy way out .\nC : you can do it for fifty cents .\nD : we've got more than fifty cents .\nC : the the case the case alone is is is the case alone for remote control is at least one euro .\nA : but we have to grou to agree upon something , because we only have minute left or so .\nC : then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station .\nA : no no , it's not possible .\nA : we can we can leave it on be then then it's this is then then our concept is ready .\nB : cheap remote control .\nA : we make some extra profit of it .\nD : no , we won't , but that's something else .\nD : no , this not gonna sell .\nB : it it won't tell , but no , , no , we just have to go all what we did today again .\nC : our remote control .\nB : you have to do it over .\nD : we come back tomorrow , ?\nA : no no there's still there's still someth concept and something special left .\nB : the no , but no .\nA : we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and looks and feel .\nA : that's what it's makes it special .\nA : and would li would have liked kinetic part as , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and will work , but it's it's an they're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen .\nC : why not hand dynamo then ?\nA : leave it like this .\nA : then it's then we're .\nD : we can't do anything else .\nD : warning , finish meeting now .\nA : project , we were gonna what look take look at the last sheet .\nC : is this it ?\nD : no , we can't .\nA : we have to , it's , .\nD : yes , yes .\nD : don't see why , but we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest .\nC : where's the champagne ?\nC : don't hear bell .\nD : no , not yet .\nD : alright , i'll see you in minute .\nB : we can do it here then .\nB : can we can't we do it here ?\nC : just fill that one in .\nB : we're doing now ."], ["<t> After introducing the remote control

</t>  <t> *NA* </t> ", "D : throwing away my toothpick .\nA : what the , ja let's just start .\nA : i've made presentation but i'll open it on the smartboard , so we can all see it .\nD : let's see it .\nA : so it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here .\nA : this is called the the the kick-off meeting .\nA : so i'm the project manager , so had to fill it in , and .\nA : and an agenda .\nA : we'll do the opening and then we'll meet each other , what we already do , so , that's not very much trouble .\nA : i'll i'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them .\nA : then we'll look at the project plan from real reaction .\nA : we'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then we'll close the meeting , and then we can individually do our things and then we'll get back here .\nA : so this the opening we'll we have to design new television remote control .\nA : you have heard that already , so .\nA : we want it to be original , so new design .\nA : trendy , it's also for young people , and we have to just make it modern .\nA : and friendly , so size does matter .\nA : and has to be have the the the buttons on the place , that kin those things .\nA : other there happen to be three stages .\nA : functional , conceptual , and detailed design .\nA : so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , and then go into the next phase .\nA : that's just it .\nA : we have these two smartboards .\nA : as showed , there's project management folder , project document folder on the desktop .\nA : it just works exactly the same as computer .\nA : you just click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop .\nA : so you can make words excel , everything .\nA : and the the the rest also works the same so when you open notepad you you just get your things , you can draw .\nA : this is drawing board .\nA : you have these different functions on the board .\nA : you can see them there .\nA : so you have pen , and it's works just like bal ball pen .\nA : this is just .\nA : doesn't work any more .\nC : you should try to write on the on the big white does it ?\nA : yes will eraser so .\nA : it's fantas fantastic .\nA : we can you can save file .\nA : so if we draw we have to save everything .\nA : don't throw anything away .\nA : just we can start new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away .\nA : just let them all stand here .\nA : we can delete , but we don't do that .\nA : you can here select pen , you can draw anything you want .\nA : it's bit childish you have to write .\nA : it's not as fast as you it , but it does work sometimes .\nA : t's just like normal paint .\nA : so it's gone .\nA : are designers , so we have to have more smartboard .\nA : so that's fantastic .\nA : this speaks for itself .\nA : we going to try it .\nA : so we all are going to draw animal on this board , not my idea .\nD : alright , your favourite animal ?\nA : yes our your favourite .\nA : so i'm to going to have to draw kangaroo , but i'm going i'm not going to .\nA : i'm just going to draw beast what i'm going to design .\nC : hope this was part of the assignment and not your hope this was part of the assignment and not your personal enjoyment .\nA : said it's not my idea but am the project manager , and officially this is my idea .\nD : we're kinda losing time , though .\nD : we're losing time , but alright .\nA : the first the first meeting is just bit loose , loosen up , bit meeting each other .\nC : so start yes .\nA : sh hope our industrial designer does this better because this is no so few legs .\nC : don't count on it .\nD : do we have to ?\nA : should make it an hippo now .\nC : it's mouse or rat .\nA : what is it , ?\nD : how to call it .\nA : difficult english word .\nA : didn't knew it myself .\nC : 'm amazed about your drawing skills .\nA : our characteristics sum it up .\nA : t's very painful those thing .\nA : so we can just we're going back and now our industrial designer can draw its most favourite animal .\nC : am the industrial designer .\nC : chief , am the industrial designer .\nA : but this marketing designer .\nC : it's pr it resembles the animal drawn by .\nA : what animal is that then ?\nC : can say it ?\nD : looks very , ?\nC : it looks amazing .\nA : no no no .\nA : what are you going to do ?\nB : we want to erase it .\nA : no no save it and start new save it and start new black doc blank document .\nC : these are very impor these are very important documents , , these drawings , and he deliberately draws animal we the english word for .\nA : we have to save everything so now the next one and then save it and start an blank document .\nD : you go man .\nA : there's also different colours and different pen widths the line the the thickness thickness .\nA : so you should try it but you could have but .\nD : should have made mine white rabbit .\nA : it speaks for itself .\nA : what the just duck .\nC : it looks like an it looks like that beast from sesame street .\nA : is it duck ?\nD : you're standing in front of it , 't see it .\nC : it's it's do we have to but we have do we have to name the specific species of the bird ?\nA : is it plane ?\nD : it's bird , but what bird ?\nA : it doesn't draw circles that easy .\nD : you have to push harder .\nA : just bit bit childish , bit .\nD : release your anger .\nB : it's just bird .\nA : save the document and then and then new blank document for .\nA : will choose new colour and new pen width so we can all see it .\nB : here you go .\nC : why do have to do the difficult tasks ?\nA : and then you go to format , and current colour you choose new colour .\nA : and new pen width also format .\nC : like they don't have pink .\nC : think this is ?\nA : it's not like in paint .\nA : and you can choose one .\nA : with each other .\nA : just wa that's the way we do it's quite easy .\nC : the line width is too thick , but .\nB : it's pussy cat .\nA : then you change it .\nA : and erase things .\nC : it smiles nicely .\nC : now have to change the line width .\nA : so we know .\nC : these are whiskers , .\nC : it's obvious now .\nD : no it looks .\nC : this isn't obvious i'll save it alright save .\nA : ll save it and start new blank document .\nD : just save it .\nA : so that's what we're going to use when we need it .\nC : feel comfortable now .\nA : t's terrific , ?\nC : for this exercise .\nD : it's good for group spirit .\nC : feel at ease .\nB : it certainly is .\nA : we're one big happy family now .\nC : something like that .\nA : then the serious .\nA : we're we want to sell it at twenty five euros internationally so but we dunno what exactly it is in dollars , but twenty five euros .\nA : our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million euros .\nA : so didn't exactly calculate how much we have to sell .\nA : we want to keep it our costs at twelve and half euros so , keep that in mind when we talk about our materials an and , and marketing research .\nA : now then we all we can sit down and discuss what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design about aim in the market etcetera ?\nA : we we can sit down because presentation can .\nA : we can take notes and who has some remarks about the current remote controls ?\nC : didn't have to prepare anything about it's not , it's it's not my task to talk about experience with current remote controls , but .\nA : just we're four if we if we would just have one then .\nD : it's im it's important to look at the remote controls of our competitors .\nD : get the good points try to merge them into one universal remote control .\nD : on our corporate site saw new d_v_d_ player we're gonna produce .\nD : it's important to make it compatible with the d_v_d_ player so you can use your television and your d_v_d_ player with the same remote control .\nA : that would be idea , yes .\nD : furthermore it's important to make it acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , , because we want to we want to fifty million ?\nA : yes fifty million is our aim to profit , so .\nD : so lot of people have to be able to use it .\nC : no but the the buttons have to have to have international recognisable buttons and and numbers and that every culture in , , people in every country can recognise .\nB : easy to learn .\nA : i'll make notes and then 'll put it in the project folder when i'm done just now .\nB : also think we should not add too many buttons .\nB : modern day remotes have too much buttons .\nA : you don't use the half of them that's that's culture international .\nD : we could make one button to switch between d_v_d_ player and t_v_ and make the other buttons multi-functional .\nC : so it doesn't become too complicated with too much buttons and and stereo audio installations .\nA : and we do we even have more than just d_v_d_ player .\nA : don't we have other ou .\nB : we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we we make ?\nA : we also just released t_f_t_ thing saw .\nD : so but that's kind standard t_ television so it also works on that .\nB : and the people who who will buy our remote already have some experience with remotes .\nB : so we can keep that in mind .\nC : most people do , .\nC : it doesn't it doesn't have to be .\nA : it doesn't have to be , but we can .\nB : t's it's new remote and you don't buy remote if you don't have anything to to control with it .\nA : except if we deliver it together with our d_v_d_ .\nD : but we need to to keep it consistent with other but it's it has to be useable .\nA : because we look at competitors and if we pick up the good things about that and give it design yes .\nC : it has to be different and familiar at the same time .\nB : we could use another form or shape or colour , that things .\nC : the shape will will have to be recognised .\nC : about like most remote controls are long box shaped thing you can make it triangle shaped , but that's not very recognisable .\nB : we could make more more oval , and and or so it's new .\nA : oo we can use it as as game pad .\nA : so one hand has the beer , so the other hand we already one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so there has been done lot of researches about remotes we have to we can imagine because it's long time on the market .\nD : not with two hands .\nD : no but it's quite important that it fits .\nB : but young people want something different and it is .\nC : but it ha it has to be .\nC : but you still have to t's remote and not another .\nA : so the the form will have been tested out so yes .\nC : so the long box shaped thing must be , , useful or else they would have been ano another shape .\nA : for me personally have lot of remotes at home but those ones that have round ending and just an square middle don't like to use them .\nA : have have to it has to fit my hands .\nA : when it falls over it and have and then the button that use most has to be here .\nD : it shouldn't be boxy .\nC : lo the long box shape .\nC : you have to use one hand .\nA : it it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb .\nD : nah don't agree with the long box shape it it has to be custom made for the hand .\nB : it doesn't fit .\nA : tho tho those new d_v_d_ players on the market do have those .\nC : but it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have no what else ?\nD : but if you shape it if no that's ol old fashioned .\nB : no if if you look at new phillips d_v_d_ with their remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped .\nC : di but what what what do you suggest then ?\nD : imagine that us .\nB : yes most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get thinner towards the the other end .\nD : it fits in your palms .\nC : but it's still then the the long box , but then with some round round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still al alright but but it's still it's still box , .\nA : it it has it it has that's tha shape that it fits your hand .\nA : that's we have five minutes left .\nC : it it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what .\nD : but it has it has to fit your hand .\nC : understand , but no no don't mean an entire box like completely square but also with round edges , but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient round shapes to fit .\nD : it shouldn't be too boxy , .\nD : it's no no no .\nD : it should be something like this or and then button here to switch between different systems like d_v_d_ player and so you can i've , and do think we have to keep this idea with the with the numbers and .\nC : yes about something like that .\nC : big recognisable button on top .\nA : so yes that's .\nC : the buttons should also be not too small , not too big , , and not too close together .\nD : but it should be possible to to make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button .\nD : so there has to be some space between the buttons .\nC : to to to have icons to explain the different functions .\nD : and we should use colours .\nB : we can just like on cell phones those you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs but .\nD : that's kinda trendy .\nC : we have to talk also about the the materials for .\nA : t's just about our first ideas now so individually we'll have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera .\nD : but it's it's important to notate all the the decisions that we make , so we .\nC : already thought about something tha .\nA : thirty minutes we have .\nA : so this is about what we are going to do .\nA : you'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so it's logical .\nA : and that's that's all .\nA : so we'll just get notice that the the meeting is over .\nC : now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left wrote down that the case should be plastic , hard plastic , the buttons should be rubbery .\nD : it shouldn't be too heavy .\nA : have had remotes that they had the function of the buttons was about layer over the buttons and when i've had use it much it was gone .\nB : that's bad , .\nA : so it has to be made in the buttons .\nA : it has to not be loose .\nC : and there are several electrical cables in it to to connect things to each other .\nA : is there an universal universal way of transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about it's not that in china it's different ?\nC : it's common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam .\nA : but you can have different between d_v_d_s and televisions and between .\nD : and you can use .\nC : it it's we we make an universal remote so it ha has to work with all kinds of brands and things .\nB : but our t_v_s are mostly made in china and that country , so .\nC : and have i've wrote something down about how it works .\nC : the user presses button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , .\nD : but are are we going with the front fronts idea ?\nA : we can look into that in the in the next thirty minutes .\nD : we should make it universal and you can always use front front on it , ?\nD : you can use it just plain but you can to make it more trendy .\nA : just you get normal front with it , but you can change them when you buy the and we should dispatch those fronts fronts around the world so those fifty million don't don't se sells itself so we have to make some extra effort like fronts .\nB : you can make profit with them , and it's way to make them trendy .\nC : but but the standard front will be just grey simple colour not not very flashy .\nA : has to it it has to fit the the te television and d_v_d_ set we are going to sell , so if they are black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so .\nB : no colour everyone accepts .\nC : pink television sets pink remote , .\nD : but people of often don't like bright colours .\nD : we have to make it grey or or black .\nB : young people li , .\nD : but then you can use front .\nC : must not forget my pen the next time .\nA : if you have television room for little children and you make if if you buy pink front they'll they'll love it .\nD : or teletubby front .\nA : but that's marketing research you can you can ask .\nA : our user interface you can what your specific instructions will be , but probably about the precision of the buttons and and those things and what buttons will have to be on the remote .\nA : and you will look into the technical design and form , .\nC : also the the look and feel of the the remote's also my task , .\nB : what's the url or the website 'cause didn't get .\nC : was wondering that too .\nC : you went to the company website .\nD : it's just if you start up your internet explorer .\nA : it it's if you finish meeting now .\nC : it's the the the start starting page very handy to know .\nB : didn't use it .\nA : we're going to back back into our rooms so in thirty minutes , but it will be you will be warned through your laptop to get over here .\nB : next meeting is in thirty minutes .\nB : it's it's handy to know .\nA : i'll have to restore my my desktop because it's it's the half of the normal size .\nC : see you in half an hour then .\nC : see you in thirty minutes then .\nA : ma that was meeting ."], ["<t> There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. </t>  <t> The target group will be people below 30. </t>  <t> It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes, especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition. </t>  <t> Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose. </t>  <t> The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. </t>  <t> The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. </t>  <t> They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information. </t>  <t> Other functions are served by push buttons: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device. </t>  <t> The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting. </t>  <t> Each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting. </t>  <t> The solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual. </t>  <t> The idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again; if it were adopted, the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself. </t>  <t> The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. </t>  <t> An LCD screen is going to be used to display information, but would not be interactive. </t>  <t> The buttons are going to include: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down. </t>  <t> There is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers. </t>  <t> The power button will be placed at the top separately. </t>  <t> The less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip, as it had been previously suggested, as there are not that many of them; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones. </t>  <t> A discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons (power, channel selection, volume) where they can be easily reached with the thumb (as many users complain of RSI), did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements. </t>  <t> Some advanced features, like LCD screen with program information or speech recognition, would be very important in order to attract their target group, but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet. </t>  <t> There was some disagreement as to whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote. </t>  <t> No consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons (zapping, volume, power) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered (to avoid RSI complaints)? </t>  <t> A special AV button for direct access to the video channel, although its necessity was disputed, because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete. </t> ", "A : 'll start just with another presentation , so then we can look at at the agenda for this meeting .\nA : i've put some new things in the in the map .\nA : this is it .\nA : the shortcut , so five .\nA : our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in .\nA : and you also ha all three of you have prepared something about it .\nA : in we'll just have look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we thought we had dec decided .\nA : but then we'll look at the three presentations from you .\nA : you have prepared all three ?\nA : we'll look at the new project requirements we .\nA : you also have received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?\nA : i've received mail with some additional requirements , and i'll have look if we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really smart to to include some things we can't , because of the new requirements .\nD : you're the only one .\nA : then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions .\nA : we have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be .\nA : and then we can discuss some more closely .\nC : we have forty minutes for this discussion ?\nA : the closing we'll not look at it yet .\nA : now i'll look at show this board .\nA : notes , first meeting .\nA : gave disc presentation .\nA : we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas .\nA : so we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors , and look at their remote controls .\nA : we should make it compatible with our new d_v_d_ and other releases we have , our technical releases .\nA : not too many one buttons .\nA : one recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with .\nA : and they can have two functions , because you have d_v_d_ and television .\nA : the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar .\nA : it's one of our ideas .\nA : that wa it's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite but have to do it .\nA : the materials should be hard plastic with rubber from , and the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible .\nA : it should be recognisable times .\nC : it's meant to be easily wiped out , .\nA : fronts were to be just like mobile telephones .\nA : and the technical aspects and also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards .\nA : that's just some ideas from the first meeting .\nA : it's quite logical al all of it .\nA : now the new project requirements , i'll just show them .\nA : got this mail from our bosses .\nA : teletext goes out .\nA : we will not use teletext .\nA : new thing , but but not teletext .\nC : disagree , but it's not it's not my place to disagree .\nA : the second is bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to include the d_v_d_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project .\nA : so that's shame , because especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .\nA : because we don't have those customers lot at at this point .\nA : t's bit pity because it's just those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can reach it .\nD : but let's forget about it .\nD : it's just time-consuming , so we have to go on .\nA : and our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .\nA : so we have to use slogan , colour , and on our remote controls the design has to be , as we already said actually , familiar .\nA : not only just the shape but also our company .\nC : we are real fashionable company .\nC : read read it on the didn't company we were , but we we design especially trendy trendy trendy .\nC : so it has to be modern design .\nC : that's important to know , when you design thing .\nA : noted our slogan that we have , our company .\nA : it's we put the fashion in electronics .\nA : so that's slogan we can put somewhere on our remote control .\nA : alright then we're going to have three presentations .\nA : you want to start ?\nD : have to start .\nA : you have to start ?\nA : didn't see anything about who had to start .\nD : no , no problem .\nD : have to to think which file's mine , 'cause was bit in hurry .\nA : you already opened powerpoint .\nD : it's this one .\nD : but i'm not .\nD : this is it .\nD : i'm going to tell you something about functional requirements .\nD : to start with these points .\nD : at first tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls , because it's smart thing to exclude those things .\nD : furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use .\nD : then tell something about the most important issues .\nD : so we have to focus on those three thing three things .\nD : and in the end i'll show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .\nD : the first findings are that people think most controls are very ug ugly .\nD : that's seventy five per cent of the current users .\nD : they don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section .\nD : they also say , that's about it was fifty per cent , that more money will be spent on better looking controls .\nD : so it's very important that you design looking control .\nD : the current user uses his machine just about all of the time for few functions .\nD : almost every user uses it the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .\nD : so it's really important to make the the buttons for the common tasks big or flashy .\nD : furthermore , it's seventy five per cent of the users zaps lot .\nD : thus it might be might be smart to make big zapping button in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .\nC : you can zap away .\nD : lot of losers users lose their controls in their in their living room .\nD : so it might be sensible to make some button on your television , that's your your control beeps , that you can find this very easily .\nD : that's an idea .\nA : should actually it should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions .\nD : 'cause it's big fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room .\nD : so but what if you lose your click-on device ?\nA : so if you deliver small click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it .\nA : no you can click it on your television .\nD : but if someone somebody else uses it in ano other room ?\nA : in another room , .\nD : nee but it it specifically says it's the the control is lost in the same room .\nD : so beeping device would be furthermore the learning time is problem .\nA : 'll have look at it , .\nD : thirty four thirty four per cent thinks it's it's too too difficult to learn .\nD : so the the learning curve should be very short for the dumbest people should be able to use it .\nC : our user expert should also consider manual manual for the remote , .\nD : but people don't read manuals .\nC : didn't read it ?\nC : users to add one ?\nC : do you think ?\nD : you should put more time in the in the design of pick up and use , than manual .\nB : yes you should you should could take look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work .\nC : because they don't use it ?\nA : there sh should always be menu , but it can be very short .\nD : and it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .\nB : but nobody reads manual about remote control , .\nC : for the if you don't recognise button who who who do call wh when it ?\nB : it sh it should be there , the manual .\nB : but but not to explain how the remote works .\nD : and we don't have much time .\nD : so it's better to put our attention to the the design .\nD : so you can pick up and use it , than .\nA : are design team , we can say to some writer make manual point .\nC : isn't it part of the of the no .\nA : so 'll have look .\nD : that's about twenty per cent .\nD : but the designer should take it should wie zeg ik dat ?\nD : consider the consequences of using your remote .\nD : it should be good in your hand .\nD : this is the most important part .\nD : we're like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target younger audience .\nD : that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's quite important .\nD : research shows that they like to have little screen on their on their zapping device .\nD : it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of the people like that .\nA : ll with twelve euro fifty as production cost , we can't afford an .\nD : so it's very important we should definitely have that in our designs .\nC : it's going to be expensive .\nD : but they t's really important .\nD : so if we want to if we have big if we make lots of of the , we can buy it very cheap , .\nD : we have to , .\nC : 'll consider it .\nA : it's your your task to look into the costs of those nigh know .\nC : we'll think abo we'll think no , we'll look we'll look into that later .\nD : don't have any information on that .\nD : and another thing is speech recognition .\nD : they also like that , but research is very costly .\nB : that's difficult to realise also .\nD : so , but it it might be important for the sale .\nC : we have very demanding clients .\nA : it's not yet standard development those so we sh .\nB : no and we have customers in multiple countries .\nD : do think is more reachable than the speech recognition .\nD : so we might consider screens .\nC : 'll consider both and and see what what what we can find , .\nC : we don't rule them out yet .\nD : it is sensible to to take this take these points into the notes .\nD : so you can .\nA : you still see your presentation .\nA : it's in the next who is next .\nA : you got yes .\nC : shall give technical talk ?\nC : it is my task to explain or to point out working design .\nC : we have that here .\nC : how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the five .\nC : the working design , that's my alright , who am and what do .\nC : so we have this .\nC : it's bit unclear because wanted to copy paste something .\nC : it was originally in black and white but it became black and purple .\nC : but you can read it .\nC : it's important for you to realise the basic function of remote control .\nC : you can see and then can select select on the dings it goes to the next page .\nD : you can select it .\nD : so it inverts .\nD : the the whole picture .\nD : nah , never mind .\nC : you can read it , it's not too difficult .\nC : meanwhile , this is schematic view of how basic remote control works .\nC : you have the energy , the power of the of the remote control , and the sender , which is the led , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .\nC : and the source is the user .\nC : the user interface is the the the buttons .\nC : and the the user interface sends the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip sends it to the led , and the led sends it to the receiver .\nC : that's the that's the basic idea .\nC : have put it in in in in couple of basic steps .\nC : the remote is just waiting for user to press key .\nC : it does nothing until the key is pressed .\nC : the key signal to chip , the chip senses the connection .\nC : and recognise the key .\nC : so you understand .\nC : the chip produces morse code , specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , .\nC : and it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send that signal again to the to the led , which is the bulb , .\nC : now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the , t's very simple , and signals the signals to the sensor on the t_v_ set , and the t_v_ set also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task .\nA : so it is also why we have to have button that says i'm now busy with d_v_d_ if we had done that .\nA : and button for t_v_ .\nC : bu , but we don't .\nC : we no no , but .\nA : so but but if you have the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same moves .\nC : this is the basic function of remote .\nC : i've some couple of pictures here .\nC : it's very basic one .\nC : and if we if we're going to add an an screen to it , it won't look anything like this , but this is very basic the the shape of of remote control .\nC : it has very little buttons and but it it it's it's quite , you can easily recognise the buttons .\nC : they're far enough apart and an anything .\nC : it's not very not very high-tech , and it's not very user-friendly .\nC : if you look at the shape , it's just simple long box shape .\nC : so we have to change little bit to that , so that it becomes more user-friendly , and that problems like r_s_i_ and those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur .\nD : can say something ?\nD : have table here about the the relevance of the buttons .\nD : the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .\nD : teletext is not an option , so that but it's very important to make the power , channel and volume buttons near to the thumb , so you can't have r_s_i_ consequences .\nC : because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately you don't have to look and and search for them .\nD : make them big , make them easy to to press .\nB : you can also like , was thinking you can are some of the the the you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .\nA : but if if you would put it at different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about r_s_i_ .\nC : you you can't have any every button under the thumb , .\nA : no but the most important buttons you can just put them bit apart so you would reject r_s_i_ r_s_i_ .\nD : that's very important .\nD : and but is that is that useable ?\nB : like some little gameboy things or some ?\nA : yes i've saw that on on mi mobile telephones they also have those buttons .\nD : do people , when they pick up remote , know that they have to do that ?\nD : it's it's new feature , you can make make double feature like button on the top and under it .\nB : alright , but , but if you say them up and down , they they'll understand it , .\nA : it's also if someone puts picks up his remote .\nB : eighty per cent would .\nA : if someone puts up picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's already on the next channel .\nD : he feels it immediately .\nA : that's very irritating , .\nC : but in in any case the the basic function should be , and as you say at the thumb .\nC : that's good idea , and and that the less important buttons , like the the the different channels , the numbers one two three four five as , should be not in reach , because they don't use it all the time .\nC : t's pretty pretty as you said .\nC : and have some pictures of the inside workings , but don't want to get too technical , because that's not very useful for you .\nA : that's your part of the job .\nC : so exactly this is how it looks from the inside .\nC : and that's about it .\nC : still have this .\nC : had to delete this , but had to make schematic of the of the new but had too too little time , but don't don't look at it .\nC : it's it's clear how it works .\nC : that's the most important thing .\nA : then mike can give the third presentation .\nA : how late is did we start his presentation ?\nD : about twenty minutes ago ?\nA : then we have still the time , so but we do have to come to decision , later on .\nD : losing time losing time .\nB : thought everybody on the website would see the same thing , but that's not the case .\nC : there are different we have all have different home pages , with different links .\nB : you couldn't see this .\nB : 'm mike , user interface designer .\nB : the the method ?\nB : used my own experience with remotes , took good look at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .\nB : yes , these are from from another manufacturer .\nD : these are already in use ?\nB : this one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and things .\nB : this one is user-centred .\nB : like user-centr centred also the best .\nA : we also do that .\nB : that we reduce the the option to control the d_v_d_ also , and teletext and that .\nB : so we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one .\nD : but we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?\nB : that's why this is not relevant any more feel .\nB : this is about the maximum number of buttons we'll need .\nB : kinda like the shape .\nB : this is what we talked about .\nB : but no i've showed it somewhere .\nC : you can't really see the differ from different sides .\nC : but you can draw it if you .\nB : we should go further with the idea of removable front .\nB : so we can can customise the ?\nA : but they all have to have something about the recognition from our company .\nA : so we cannot just make someone no but that's the side they look look at is the front .\nB : it's not the the whole remote that changes , .\nD : but it , .\nA : so if if you make front with just tiger on it , then our recognition is gone .\nB : or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .\nB : so like ericsson does every something like this .\nD : we must have that .\nC : we can put it on the on the back side .\nA : and and yes .\nD : we can make symbol of the company here .\nD : and if you put front on it , there's hole on the front .\nD : so the symbol's always on .\nC : so that you don't replace the symbol , .\nB : something like that , in the .\nA : or the the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front .\nD : but let's not focus on the front .\nB : so like said we'd we'd use more function .\nB : if we we had to include more functions .\nB : but we don't .\nB : this is about the maximum number of buttons we need .\nB : like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need .\nC : mike , can you put that picture from me on the in the word documents file ?\nB : for the remote less is more .\nB : the less buttons the better the design .\nB : we should go with that concept .\nD : i've i've got another point .\nD : there are two target audi audiences , and we've chose for the younger one .\nD : research has shown that it's high interested in features .\nD : they are high high interested in feature .\nD : but they are more critical .\nD : fo , critical .\nD : so the younger audience .\nD : so we must must design control that really speaks to the people .\nA : what if we at at home have remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has little clip , little you can click away and then you have much more functions that most people don't use but some do do .\nC : the most functions underneath that no usually but most most .\nD : clip aren't used much .\nA : but because you say they their features are important , they want lot , but not .\nB : but what features ?\nB : like screens and voice recognition .\nB : but i've , that's .\nD : here , look at these numbers .\nD : the newest features are , like said , are and speech control .\nD : our audience , these people , are very like these features .\nD : so we must build in something , or they will to go to the concurrent .\nD : so , do think we have to have some features .\nD : even though they cost little more .\nA : we could on some calculators you have lo those little little that you can click on , or that you can click out of the remote .\nA : and if if that's gives you little bit of sta status information .\nD : which programme you are watching .\nA : those things , because you also have those those program recognition for your v_ v_c_r_s .\nA : and if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching .\nC : so it it just signals the the different sig the different symbols on the screen you have , because if you change to channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your on your screen .\nA : it it could be such little that you can click in and out and you and you have it .\nB : we should keep that simple too .\nC : but should it really be clickable , or or just integrate inside to try to make it more trendy .\nB : it will no , it should be integrated .\nD : no not clickable .\nD : nah , no no no .\nB : something like on some radios in car .\nD : just at at the top .\nD : so when you you sit like this you can can watch .\nD : it should be at the top .\nB : you where it's , , walking to .\nD : it's ticker-tape idea .\nC : but that's bit more expensive than the basic calculator design , with the scrolling text and that thing .\nD : t's just one script .\nA : it's you got it just means it's script that's keeps it rolling , and it's not that's five minutes off implementing time .\nD : five minutes of ja ja for programming .\nD : so don't think that's the issue .\nD : alright , we go with the screen ?\nA : so , yes .\nB : we we we still need to know how much that will cost .\nA : we're no but we're we'll have to look into that .\nD : if find that , but next time .\nB : or you will get that information .\nA : we can use this board again , .\nA : we can put some decisions about the controls we want , the issue .\nA : where is my presentation ?\nA : we're all here now , .\nD : understand what you're saying .\nD : we should have general idea of how it's gonna look .\nA : these i've already given you .\nA : so we have to decide on the different remote control functions .\nA : so we want to have small screen that's special .\nD : at the top .\nC : shouldn't we start with the most important parts ?\nB : at the top or at the bottom ?\nC : the screen alright but we should start with the power button ?\nD : the top is more when you how do you zap ?\nB : but but with with the screen on the top it gets bit unnatural .\nD : you just sit in your chair ?\nD : with the remote ?\nA : that thing is terrible .\nB : 'cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .\nD : but that's where your hand ball might be .\nA : mike mike has point , because when when when use remote hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .\nC : and then we should centralise the discussion here .\nD : we'll draw two , and then we'll see no he thinks , .\nC : what you were talking about but we are busy with something .\nD : he thinks it's better to put the at the bottom , and it's better at the top .\nC : why do you t's better at the bottom ?\nB : because most remotes have some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .\nC : but you just can put the the the the the whole interface bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface .\nB : that's that's ugly but .\nD : the the ticker the is like like small .\nD : it's it's wide .\nD : it's not not high .\nC : and and we can bottom .\nB : power button always .\nA : so and and like to use the ones on the top .\nB : you gotta zap like this or you want to .\nA : so when when have to have an scr window yes but we we we we don't want that .\nD : but we're making remote with with few functions .\nC : that's bit exaggerated .\nC : agree with you .\nC : it's it's also more recognisable .\nC : it looks more like calculator to people , if you have the the the the thing on top .\nB : you don't want you want it it it must be remote .\nA : we don't want them to look like calculator .\nA : we want to look it like our original but familiar yea bic better white we white ?\nC : but you don't have to throw important aspe important aspect like familiarity completely away , because it's it's still important to have it at the top , because it's it's more familiar that way .\nD : that's not problem .\nD : when draw here it .\nA : it's bit off .\nC : little little bit .\nD : it it needs to be calibrated again .\nA : let's talk about that later it's special pen .\nC : you should another pen .\nC : you you only have one pen for that screen .\nD : alright , we have to make decision now , because we don't have much time .\nD : we have few functions , and we can put the above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .\nA : it should be at the button , bottom .\nC : 'm the i'm the designer , so .\nB : at the bottom ?\nB : in few minutes , , agree .\nD : at the bot so we are two v_s_ two .\nA : but what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design .\nB : he's the boss .\nC : we we were busy with that .\nA : because we have to decide this .\nC : we should summon the the different aspects of the thing .\nC : so , we have the power button .\nD : and moreover that you two should be come to consensus about the .\nD : it's your it's your job .\nB : no it's our job .\nA : have power button .\nC : wh while you have to agree , say it's like this and you must agree .\nB : for all of us .\nD : alright , let's keep it central .\nA : we have power button , setting buttons , window , the number buttons yes .\nB : the ten numbers ?\nC : let's look at your design .\nA : the mute button .\nA : love that one .\nB : we we should use something like this to the the channel up and channel down button ?\nB : in circle , ?\nA : that's that's also design .\nB : and and volume control also in it .\nC : but on this remote these controls are else , d_v_d_ player .\nB : yes , as already said , we could drop some of these buttons .\nA : they are for some video apart .\nC : so , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand .\nD : you should put that power button , channel and volume should have the most importance .\nB : these should be in one big circle in the middle .\nD : but what he said about r_s_i_ was kinda true .\nD : when when you put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what r_s_i_'s all about .\nD : so it might be smarter to put them little more away from each other .\nA : so people have to move their hand .\nA : and they get less complaints of r_s_i_ .\nA : that's what always do , because all my important buttons are the same place .\nC : it's good to move from time to time .\nB : but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place .\nD : frequency of button use .\nB : they they need to be centred .\nC : no but now would we have to choose way in middle ?\nD : channels are most is most used within the hour .\nD : you can see .\nD : so the the channel channel buttons should be far far apart , , up and down .\nB : no don't think .\nA : up and down far apart from each other ?\nD : you thinking about r_s_i_ ?\nB : but but no .\nA : not too much .\nD : look at look at the frequency .\nD : nei not too much , but nei nei nei agree .\nB : the other the other two frustrations are far more important .\nB : so they are used four times an hour , so power bu button should be left at the top .\nC : you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .\nA : the power button , you can if someone is constantly zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not beside it .\nA : because have someone but the buttons is way .\nA : so that one can be put away .\nA : the power button can be yes .\nD : and should and should be red .\nA : man , five minutes .\nA : five minutes left .\nD : just make some decisions .\nD : the most important things we have to do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now .\nA : how are we going to do it with those numbers ?\nC : can you make you make we can use the drawing board now , .\nC : it it doesn't work but but it it would be pretty pretty if we could just draw simple thing .\nA : have it here .\nA : that's going to take too too much time .\nD : just you decide that , you decide that , and ready .\nA : you are industrial , you are user interface .\nA : so it's going to go to mike .\nA : but you will have to make consensus with .\nA : t's bit hard , because we are going to be individually .\nB : consensus , we we can put it in the middle , so alright .\nD : we're no we're deciding now , so top or bottom ?\nA : that's bit yes .\nC : still t's it's quite important though to to have it at the top , so .\nA : yes it is .\nC : you say familiarity isn't important but .\nA : what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?\nA : plus the the design round is still to come ?\nA : alright these functions .\nC : as we we we we , we do have .\nA : the number yes , that's alright .\nC : so that's that's enough .\nA : the number function .\nA : are we going to do it like on mike's screen with one button that says i'm going to do two number digital ?\nA : how do you want it to do then ?\nC : there's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .\nB : just when you push one one and no , if you on most t_v_s if you press two numbers shortly after each other , it .\nA : it it has to recognise one as there could still come more .\nC : they'd recognise it .\nC : that's the most that that's very easy .\nA : alright so no button for that .\nA : anyone any oth other functionalities of our remote ?\nC : these are the the most important functions .\nD : do you still have the pictures over there ?\nA : so no , we'd just said we didn't because we can't integrate it with any other remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant .\nD : that's about it .\nD : you do need the multi or did no , like this one .\nD : you do need them ?\nD : but are we alright , alright now .\nA : so just for television is we need ?\nD : it's most useable this way .\nA : teletext is gone .\nA : so all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext screen placing .\nA : we'll have those buttons about and the two important ones we're forgetting .\nA : you can make it wider and less wide .\nA : and the button that you can go to a_v_ for your video .\nD : do think we have to put that underneath clip .\nA : but it's just two , and we make clip ?\nC : just two just two under under but you you can put two or three buttons under another section .\nA : that's bit waste .\nB : we we can make make little row of like four buttons down here .\nA : or at the top .\nA : your screen is going to go .\nB : or at then .\nC : that's that's too complicated .\nC : you can just put it somewhere they they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere bit smaller and and and more at the bottom .\nA : they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .\nB : they can be small or round like buttons .\nC : or at the top , .\nC : what do you think those those buttons ?\nC : above or down ?\nC : design it later .\nC : we have it , and we design later where everything goes .\nA : any other go to video , that's always on your remote control .\nD : you you take those if you , but you can you can zap you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to , but when you zap down zero you get to a_v_ .\nB : why go to video ?\nA : to a_v_ to a_v_ a_v_ a_v_ .\nC : the the video channel ?\nB : that's just zero .\nA : no not at not at my remote .\nC : no no not always .\nC : ze zero is different channel than the the video channel .\nB : but you can can zap down yes , no , then you press ninety nine .\nA : go to ninety-nine .\nB : go to video is an irrelevant button , but you must have .\nA : that's the button no .\nC : but it's easy to go if you are at at channel fifty five and you want to go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push to to get below zero .\nA : no you can ch push zero .\nC : it's more easy to get to where the specific video channel button .\nA : that one button is use it ?\nD : but if we're choosing to incorporate these buttons , you have to have channel setting , if you wa if you have new t_v_ .\nD : you have to set the channels .\nD : all these different buttons you have to , do .\nA : these buttons , don't have buttons for channel setting especially on my remote .\nC : different screen settings , sk you you you you have screen width .\nA : it's it's incorporated with plus and down , those so we still have one four ?\nB : you you have one one button from set frequency , and then with plus and min minus you can adjust the , alright .\nD : that's the only one we put in there .\nD : for screen fu channel setting .\nC : to to configure the programme the .\nA : you always have in the centre an button , for your menu .\nC : and and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .\nA : channel , setting , menu .\nA : we have to go .\nC : the menu menu button is also important .\nC : then you can where ?\nA : yes have put it in .\nC : don't see it .\nC : menu , alright .\nB : things like contrast and brightness should be in the menu , .\nC : in the menu .\nC : and you can then adjust it with the zapping buttons .\nB : the or the volume like that .\nC : because the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu .\nC : or the volume , .\nA : we're going to go to our rooms , and we'll have to decide things on our own .\nA : so see you we have lunchtime , by the way , now so lunch .\nB : we'd lunch now , or not ?\nC : this is this is your thing .\nD : get into my belly .\nC : see you later mate ."], ["<t> For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. </t>  <t> The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote. </t>  <t> Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front. </t>  <t> The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip. </t>  <t> Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions. </t>  <t> He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes. </t>  <t> The team drew a provisional prototype. </t>  <t> They placed the LCD below the buttons. </t>  <t> If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design. </t>  <t> Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved. </t>  <t> Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched. </t>  <t> The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype, where they will also sort out the details about the buttons. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will carry out an evaluation of the product. </t>  <t> The push buttons are going to be made of rubber. </t>  <t> The chip needs to be an advanced one to be compatible with the LCD screen that is going to be incorporated in the design. </t>  <t> Making changeable fascias can allow for the integration of this or future fashion trends in the device. </t>  <t> The team agreed to place the LCD at the bottom of the device, below the buttons. </t>  <t> TV settings will be included in menus there instead of having separate buttons for them. </t>  <t> They will implement speech recognition as well, because their target group like such gimmicks. </t>  <t> The case will be titanium with a plastic front with rounded buttons. </t>  <t> Parts of the front (like the bottom where the LCD is and the top corner where the logo is) will also be titanium. </t>  <t> The chip is going to be a standard one. </t>  <t> They will launch the product with various fronts to choose from including a couple of basic colours or fruit and vegetable themes to go with the current fashion. </t>  <t> The logo will be both at the front and the back of the remote; the company slogan will be engraved at the back. </t>  <t> The team found a possible conflict between the need for strong materials and the customers' preference for soft textures. </t>  <t> Plastic may be strong, but it does not necessarily look it. </t>  <t> The version of speech recognition discussed does not link voice commands to actual device actions. </t>  <t> Changing the front colours may make the front clash with the titanium, but it was also thought neutral enough for it not to matter. </t>  <t> They wondered whether to use both the logo and the slogan on the device and where it would be best for them to be placed. </t> ", "A : door is closed .\nA : because if we have as much time as the last meeting , we'll have to hurry up .\nA : 'll start with the presentation again , the agenda .\nA : i'll show you the notes .\nA : it's not as interesting as it should be because we just had the meeting , but i'll show them .\nA : we'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design .\nA : then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts .\nA : i've put file in the project management folder , which says exactly what decisions we should take .\nA : so this time we exactly to decide about .\nA : and then we'll close again .\nA : these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later .\nA : we'll first look at your presentations .\nA : walter will start again this time ?\nD : alright , trendwatch .\nD : will speak about latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and things we must not do .\nD : it's very important that the control is fancy looking and good feeling .\nD : this because of our last model was very functional , but it people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking .\nD : that's something you have to take look at .\nD : and the feeling has to be very .\nD : also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel .\nD : there's minus two times here , because this is the most important point .\nD : this is two times as less important , and same for this one .\nD : technological technological innovations , that's regarded very highly too .\nD : such as an screen , speech acknowledgement , as we talked about earlier .\nD : so we have to have something like that , like we .\nA : and our our fronts .\nD : the last point is easy to use .\nD : that speaks for for itself .\nD : who's who's going to look at that .\nC : easy to use ?\nA : easy to use is bit contradictionary with the first functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .\nC : that's your ta .\nA : have to choose one of them .\nD : we have to go for the first one .\nD : it's the most important one .\nD : so we have to take that one .\nD : so it it it isn't very important that that it works easy .\nB : something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .\nD : but it has to look .\nA : we'll we'll look at .\nC : , you can make very complicated remote anyway , so ease of use it's not very comp complicated device .\nD : but the most important thing is that it looks and people say , that's real concept .\nD : these are the new colours of this year .\nD : so it must be very bright , very colourful .\nD : people like this .\nD : so we we have to think in this direction .\nD : so set your mind to it .\nD : fruit and vegetables are .\nD : the group we are targeting is very pleased with fruit and vegetables .\nD : so we we we might cons consider in front of in in that way .\nD : furthermore material , that's your part , should be very strong .\nD : was thinking of something like iron plate over it , in colour , that looks so really flashy but it it is also strong .\nD : and that's also for the younger public .\nA : the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends ev every year .\nA : this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something different .\nD : but we can all make the the fronts of titanium really thin .\nD : so it looks very heavy but you can still use it very easily .\nD : older people like dark colours and simple shapes .\nD : don't want older people , we want young people .\nD : so we're gonna turn that around .\nD : we're gonna have real shapes and lots of colours .\nA : wood is popular .\nD : we don't want wood .\nC : among the old people , .\nD : so , that's it for me .\nC : am going to tell you something about the components design .\nC : again have put up the specification properties .\nC : this so the different components of the of of the device .\nC : and the materials ?\nC : have heard several things , so i'll have to change that on the way .\nC : but the case ?\nC : suggested in the previous meeting hard plastic .\nC : but as you indicated it should be strong .\nD : we should change that .\nC : it should feel strong .\nC : so plastic is not sufficient .\nC : we should move to something .\nA : it it it is , but it doesn't look strong .\nA : so but we still have to look at our price .\nC : hard plastic is pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have really really tough look .\nD : no no no .\nA : because if we want an window etcetera ?\nC : but we'll return to that .\nC : the buttons rubber , everyone agrees .\nC : and electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic .\nC : the chips made of silicon , .\nC : that's the best way to do it .\nC : and infra infrared led is just simple bulb .\nC : then i've had few findings , made few findings .\nC : the target audience product style .\nC : it's generally the case that senior and wealthy people above forty five years old like , as you said , particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that .\nC : they also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style .\nC : but that's not our things this .\nC : so this is things we must not do .\nC : and then we have young and dynamic people , which is our group , the people we aim at .\nC : under forty five years old .\nC : they like soft materials with primary colours .\nC : soft materials is agai again bit contradiction with our material choice of what you said , that it should be hard an and and and and strong looking .\nC : but they like soft materials , so we might we have to consider that .\nC : and also they like curved round shapes .\nC : so not too formal like like the older people want .\nC : and if also finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as discmans for jogging and that those devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device .\nC : but since we don't have really sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that .\nA : sports , they're that are accessible on on your window ?\nC : also have several examples of styles , so you can get clear picture of what .\nA : all the results ?\nD : we keep coming back to the fronts .\nC : these are the basic older older peoples' .\nC : it was not very interesting , very classical looking , but that's that's not what we want .\nC : we have these things .\nC : what exactly they are .\nC : it looks like you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , bright colours and round shapes .\nC : you also see this device , it's not very round and fruity .\nC : it that's true .\nC : and round shapes , primary colours .\nC : you can see it all here .\nC : and this famous device .\nC : as something some devices like this .\nC : so to give you an idea of this has strong look .\nD : t's got strong look , this .\nC : although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look .\nD : it still has strong look .\nA : and it's round .\nD : but then you are losing your fruity colours .\nC : have to make can't really make round round remote control .\nA : you can make that middle ring can you you can make another colour .\nA : so those things you can you can combine .\nC : don't think that's very practical , but but it's important to to to think about the colour .\nA : no , it isn't .\nC : because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it lot more does make it looking lot more stronger .\nD : but the but it doesn't have to look strong .\nC : 'cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , becau but this is plastic , and and this too , but the feel ?\nD : the the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy .\nA : so , if you ti you you you should have some some coloured titanium .\nB : and it it doesn't have to be strong , also .\nD : nah the feel .\nB : only the feel .\nA : so it it looks pretty but it feels strong .\nC : and then have some more findings .\nC : about the energy energy source of the of the device , suggest the basic battery .\nC : got some other energy sources .\nC : but solar energy is not very practical inside house , because you don't have have lot of sun .\nC : and kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , , for for simple remote , that's bit , , that's bit that's bit much .\nC : and also suggest as shape double curved case .\nC : the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium .\nC : that that's the information received .\nC : if you use the curved case , curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium .\nA : what do you exactly mean with double curved ?\nC : now this to give it more modern look .\nC : and now the the shape , , curved case .\nC : more modern look not plain , long box style , but i'll draw it , but later .\nA : it it mean , .\nC : and it makes it gives it more user friendly shape , than if you have .\nC : anyway as for the buttons , simple push buttons .\nC : no otherwi no difficult scroll things or some things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive .\nC : and , as we , we don't use speaker or sensor or speak speech controlled device .\nC : because it makes it also more complex and expensive .\nC : but we do use an screen , so we we do have to consider of we have to use more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .\nC : but it's worth the trouble , because rubber is soft material , .\nA : this soft material thing from .\nB : the buttons can be made of an soft material .\nB : because people like that .\nC : so that's what want to talk about .\nA : we will take that .\nA : and then mike ?\nB : nah the method we will include the buttons as we discussed earlier .\nB : an screen will be implemented .\nB : we must decide where , this meeting .\nB : there are new developments in speech recognition systems , and they are already being used on coffee machines .\nB : and they're cheap , so we could use them now .\nB : it's not really speech recognition , it's more like you can talk to the chip , record the message and record an answer , and then once you talk to the remote , then he will answer with the the prerecorded message that you left .\nB : so if say hi mike , and you have recorded hi mike back , then you will get that .\nA : but you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .\nB : no it doesn't does not do anything .\nB : but it's just it's it's cheap .\nA : that's bit yes .\nD : but that that makes it cheap .\nD : it's it's just an extra function , and it's cheap .\nA : but it has no functionality for our remote .\nD : no but , .\nB : no but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .\nC : but it it's for young people .\nD : young people love them .\nB : yes , we we should really include that one , .\nC : they like gadgets .\nC : if it's cheap .\nB : as said earlier the screen should be positioned at the lower end of the remote .\nB : the buttons for screen width and general settings and and that we can also do let that functions be shown in the screen , instead of extra buttons .\nA : so you put menu in the ?\nB : young people and every user would like that .\nB : the buttons should be positioned positioned the same way as they are on , , conventional remote , .\nB : for the learnability and to keep it recognisable .\nB : voice recognition can be implemented .\nB : and drew an example , but it did not work quite the the way wanted it to do .\nC : can you draw it now of can you draw it now ?\nD : how how how do you give input to the menu on the screen ?\nB : have the draw it again , and did wrong .\nB : didn't tick the note bo box in the .\nB : with the the up and down and and buttons and the will draw what had drawn on the screen .\nD : so you have menu button , and then you can go up and down .\nA : but then we should also have an an button .\nB : shall draw this .\nB : if it works .\nA : just there is already blank .\nD : you have to push hard .\nC : suggest banana shape .\nC : because of the fruity fashion .\nA : no next year that's out .\nC : yellow and , .\nB : these little buttons are bit difficult to draw correct .\nC : those are the the cha the channel buttons ?\nB : just the numbers .\nC : and then below is the screen ?\nB : these these will be bigger in the the real design .\nB : this must be the button used to interact with the screen .\nB : and with this you can , yes , go to through the menus and that can the video button should be an apart button , because you want it to , , to use it fast within one click .\nA : and what's the menu button ?\nD : and you you need you need speaker .\nB : this button can also be the menu button , we use in the menus we can add another button here , but .\nA : but how did how do you get out of the menu then ?\nA : you could just do an an exit with .\nC : by pe pressing the menu button again .\nC : by pressing the menu button again , you go out .\nA : yes , but bec because when you push menu you get in , and then you have to push when you get to choice .\nC : it's usual the the the the way it works .\nB : you you no no , we we we should add extra menu button and this the button .\nA : and that's also the button .\nC : but you can men you can press menu again to get out .\nA : that's you you should have or you can put in the l_c_d_'s window an option get out .\nB : once you have an extra menu button , you don't need that that extra option .\nA : it's just choice .\nB : you have redundancy .\nD : but we need we need recording recording button for the speech part .\nD : or don't , and spea speaker at the back , .\nB : if we decide to to implement that , we should .\nC : why would you put it then , and where is the recording the microphone ?\nC : where would you put it ?\nB : they that could be anywhere .\nB : that's very small .\nB : it could be down here .\nB : but that's just little gap .\nB : the speaker and the microphone , , are the same little hole thingy .\nC : but we could do , but it's perhaps more expensive , the speaker on the back .\nB : there are all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be very expensive .\nB : but this is my suggested design .\nA : then let's have look at the decisions we are going to have to make .\nB : and as you can see so , the screen does look better at the lower end , or at the bottom .\nB : but , had some examples .\nC : live with it .\nB : you can but did not like it very much , but these are quite obvious , very ugly remote .\nC : they do they don't look fruity enough .\nD : nei they're they're not trendy .\nA : they're all black .\nA : that one like .\nB : this is for children but no .\nC : tho those but it doesn't the , .\nD : it doesn't look strong .\nB : but with the colours it's bit the way we're going to .\nB : this is terrible this looks .\nD : this is just crazy .\nA : it's it's all too much buttons .\nC : but it it must not look too childish ?\nA : too many buttons .\nA : that's , that's too expensive .\nB : this these are the screens .\nB : we should , if it's possible , one with colours , but too expensive ?\nD : nah it's too expensive .\nB : ha , even more .\nB : this is what we've just done .\nD : but are we going for strange form ?\nA : no , not very strange .\nD : 'cause people like that .\nC : not not too strange .\nD : not too strange .\nD : you can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the is .\nA : it still has yes .\nA : so it falls over the hand .\nD : if the no nokia telephone , with the round thing at at the bottoms , something like that .\nA : have at home remote with bridge .\nA : it's just half round half half circle at and then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very .\nA : that's it feels comfortable .\nD : but people like something new .\nC : we have , .\nC : will design it , we design it later .\nC : so we'll get to that later .\nA : where did put it ?\nC : the specific shape .\nA : conceptual phase , this is it .\nC : the our sources .\nA : got this from our friends .\nA : so the conceptual design .\nA : these are few examples which we have to decide about .\nA : all the the materials from the case , the electric cable that's all your your side of the story .\nA : now from the user interface , your package ?\nA : where no , that's more like the buttons where they have to come .\nA : and bit of , , bit of design .\nC : but we should decide now .\nA : yes , but we have to decide about these now .\nD : materials are the most , most impor .\nA : and the trend-watching .\nA : so as you said , fruity is in , sells good .\nC : so we have to put it in one document .\nA : so if we go through them why should .\nC : copy paste this story into into word document , and then put the answers after the subjects .\nC : have to decide all these things ?\nB : but all these examples are of coffee machine .\nC : we can override them ?\nA : so what what properties should it have ?\nC : suggest what do suggest actually ?\nB : we why don't we use titanium or or hard , , some metal for the the the whole remote except the front .\nD : do the new no no the front is the most important .\nB : that just like most cell phones are .\nC : so we have titanium .\nC : but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that strong look .\nC : and then the front is made of plastic .\nC : and you can put that on and off , and switch it .\nD : but the feel of plastic isn't strong .\nC : no but you have titanium .\nB : no but you you have this .\nC : you have the best of both worlds .\nB : you have the re remote in your hand like this .\nB : so you feel titanium .\nC : and , , you have the the the plastic front end .\nC : but you also have the titanium .\nD : fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas , but it it's expensive .\nC : but you have to make decision .\nB : and if you can make steel just any way you want it to .\nC : the according to my sources , it's it's possible to make an entire titanium is available , and we can make an entire remote out of it , if we want .\nB : any colour , then you you paint it in the colour you want it .\nB : the plastic is is the colour you want it .\nD : so , we're going for titanium back and plastic front ?\nA : i've titanium back , plastic front .\nA : am going to put it in here , because we can look .\nA : solid feel and trendy look .\nA : so material , hard plastic for the front ?\nC : for the front and then titanium for the back .\nC : for the non-removable part .\nD : but then you have the problem , when you have titanium back , you can't switch it .\nD : when you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match .\nC : but the titan titanium isn't isn't very , it doesn't curves .\nB : titanium is neutral .\nC : titanium is very no no no , but titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have purple front on it or orange front .\nC : if if you disagree , but it's doesn't matter very much .\nB : our customers will use those funky trendy colours , and they don't use wood .\nC : and even if it does doesn't match , it will people like colours that don't match .\nA : and the the electrical cable is just normal .\nC : cop copper material .\nB : the electrical cable does no we don't use an electrical cable .\nA : it's from our coffee .\nC : copper ba basic in nside the remote control we use couple of external ?\nB : inside , but this is for the coffee machine .\nB : but that's not what's meant here , .\nC : coffee grind doesn't have na ja .\nC : never mind the coffee grind .\nA : all the all the inside work of our remote is standard work .\nA : so the chip is normal silicon .\nA : the buttons are normal , etcetera .\nA : so that's just easy .\nA : we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier remotes .\nA : the conceptual specification of the user interface ?\nA : have our beautiful drawing .\nB : got better one here and will the shared folder .\nA : you can put that in into the shared folder , and then i'll put it in our end report .\nB : will work this out for the next meeting .\nA : yes , you can .\nA : you can put some which button is what .\nA : the trend-watching included these days .\nA : and what do we ?\nA : we thing that fruit and bright colours are yes .\nC : the the the front .\nD : we can launch couple of packages .\nD : you can buy different of of machine , but it's the same thing , but with another front .\nD : so and you can you can .\nA : we can also implement we can also implement fronts from movies that are very hot .\nB : that's the whole idea of the front .\nB : but that's for later on .\nB : the fronts you can do anything with them .\nD : but if you if you launch five different packages like ipod mini .\nB : for the initiative launch .\nC : for the for the launch , .\nD : it's good marketing .\nA : launch different lines at once .\nC : so then couple of basic colours .\nC : not not very sim not .\nD : not too heavy .\nD : you can always take another pick .\nA : we should not give them the the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time .\nD : they have to buy it later on .\nA : we still have to make those fifty million , ?\nC : very boring , .\nB : you can you can give them three or so , so that they can experiment with it and that they want more .\nC : the most boring fronts possible .\nA : the most ugly .\nC : but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , and and and we still have to make we have still have to make the es the the real basic design .\nB : red red , blue and green you give them , and then you can give them other ones .\nA : the buttons etcetera , we get from mike .\nA : this fruit and bright colours , we'll have to in the next half an hour , we'll have to specify the different types we want to launch , when we ntroduce our remote .\nC : because we have the sketch but alright , .\nD : but we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing .\nD : else it won't sell .\nD : so lost my mouse .\nA : 'll have to , before get another warning for five minutes , i'm going to get where is my mouse ?\nA : where is my mouse ?\nA : this is it .\nA : this we have .\nA : interface we have .\nA : cheap voice recording .\nB : we should do that .\nC : we all agree on that .\nA : industry designer , .\nA : user interface , mike .\nA : you're going to work together on prototype drawing on the smartboard .\nB : we can do that .\nC : together or together .\nD : togeth you can take the smartboard .\nC : how , but how do some some non functional tasks .\nA : that's what got to hear .\nB : but bu we stay we stay here ?\nA : yes 'll get it to hear that .\nA : they're saying smartboard and that's it this is the smartboard , so so you can you you are going to make prototype , and that's includes specifying the buttons etcetera .\nB : and take it to our rooms and , specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nA : so you'll get it on your on your laptop .\nA : you will go and do something else on the project project evaluation .\nA : so , what are you going to do ?\nA : what product evaluation exactly means , but you'll get the specifications .\nD : we don't have produ product yet , so difficult .\nA : that's why but how long do we still have ?\nC : no but , can we talk about something else ?\nC : no anything , but anyone else ?\nB : will we use round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ?\nC : to make it as as round as possible .\nB : and these these these buttons are more triangle-ish shaped with square one in the middle .\nA : why does fuck you .\nD : so you can see you have to up or down .\nC : but now see the that depends .\nD : and this must be volume , and this programme .\nB : most of the time up and down is programme and left and are volume , .\nA : we can't get ts it doesn't work any more .\nB : it depends , but if you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up .\nC : we we we'll just give them an we'll design it , and then they can give comments on it .\nA : we can't save them .\nA : so we'll just have them standing there .\nD : you can't click the corners .\nA : it's bit bit pity .\nD : it's real real thing .\nA : still have more than five minutes .\nA : so what are we going to do ?\nA : as project manager ha don't have clue .\nD : let's start the design .\nA : we can decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote .\nC : logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be , why not ?\nA : also the slogan ?\nA : on the we put the fashion in electronics .\nC : if there's enough space , you can put we'll we'll , our slogan is not very long .\nB : i'd say only the logo .\nB : too much text and it gets too too busy .\nC : it's just simple what is it ?\nB : t's quite long phrase .\nA : we put the fashion in electronics .\nD : but we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts .\nC : you but you can put it on the back , on the titanium part .\nC : the logo and the and the they do .\nB : the logo should be on the top .\nA : on the top .\nA : in in the top corner ?\nB : corner , yes .\nA : and you on the back , you can put at the bottom , you can put the logo with the .\nC : corner , or here in the middle ?\nD : but the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front .\nA : just just small .\nB : at the back ?\nC : it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front .\nA : carved into the material .\nB : you can the logo can be on on every front .\nD : but you can scratch it off .\nD : it's better if you have it .\nB : but then you must really push it in .\nA : no , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back .\nC : like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing .\nC : but am the only one , or no not on the front , but on the backside .\nB : on the backside .\nA : management would like it .\nB : not not on the front side , .\nA : the front side , no no no slogan .\nB : on the back yes , you you can , , push that in , so that it is always be there .\nC : it's idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan .\nC : to make more of an impression .\nD : but not too big .\nC : not too big .\nC : no , very small .\nC : not on the entire back , but just very small .\nC : but readable enough .\nA : yes , slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front but not exchange ?\nC : but we'll we'll take that with us into the design .\nB : over here the logo .\nC : or here in the middle , but we'll decide later .\nA : when changing fronts .\nA : alright , that's decided .\nC : do you do you see bit of the of the of the titanium ?\nA : five minutes left .\nC : on the front ?\nC : if we make this this this lower part titanium , the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the screen .\nB : yes we could no , they have two fronts , that .\nA : so bit of titanium between ?\nC : no no betwe of between we can do but but then you have two parts of front , two fronts that this enti entire bottom ?\nA : that's bit that that's that's pretty .\nD : no no no no .\nD : you have to make this titanium too .\nB : you you can .\nD : else you you get problems with the .\nD : like dust in it and so things like that .\nD : when you exchange all the fronts and it's open .\nA : already have all kinds of filth between the mobile .\nB : no , you can you can just and then not straight line but some wave .\nC : and then the lower part is titanium ?\nB : this is titanium .\nB : and this is front .\nD : some some wei weight in it .\nC : like that bit of titanium also on the bit like bit like your mobile phone .\nB : with the with the curved edge .\nC : you can show it .\nC : it also has the those two distinct bit like this .\nD : you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is .\nD : because it has to be there all the time .\nA : so round where ?\nD : so little corner of titanium .\nB : that's finishing touch you need .\nA : yes , that also sounds pretty neat .\nD : so this this is the exchangeable part .\nC : i'm going to buy it .\nA : we want it .\nB : this is the front .\nA : and it's only twenty five euros .\nB : this is the my design .\nC : that's bit too much , but no , no no no , but this looks pretty actually .\nA : no that's nothing .\nA : the phillips remote costs more .\nC : because it's my design but no our our design , alright .\nD : taking all the credit .\nA : you two are going to work together .\nA : you'll get your specifications on your laptop , and then you we can , it's , , we have one .\nB : we'll stay here ?\nD : but there's problem .\nD : we can't take blank one .\nD : or can we ?\nB : can erase an animal .\nB : the fourth one .\nD : nah that's alright , that's alright .\nC : but don't erase my cat .\nB : the fourth one is empty , isn't it ?\nC : want to preserve it .\nD : this one is empty .\nD : you have to empty one ?\nC : what are you doing chief ?\nA : so , you can draw .\nB : we have to ?\nA : 'll get i'll get the message .\nC : until the until the beep goes .\nC : but don't do we have to stay here , or we have to return first .\nA : no , you'll you can keep your laptop here .\nA : or get your mouse .\nA : because it's little bit hard to work with these plates .\nC : the high powers from above will have to tell us , .\nD : it's not relaxing .\nA : always have mouse next to my laptop .\nA : hate these ugh .\nD : don't have laptop .\nC : we can do touch-pad on our remote .\nC : no just kidding .\nC : have you have to have bit of humour in the in the discussions too , because it becomes too too too too stressy .\nA : and in your remote control .\nA : so we put touch pad on it , and say ha ha .\nB : this has no function .\nA : we know you'll you'll you'll hate it but but they do want some gadgets .\nC : but youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so .\nD : it's all about things .\nA : so that's wha what we're doing .\nD : and it will sell .\nD : we will be rich .\nA : our bosses will be rich .\nB : we've done too much in the previous meetings .\nB : yes , we've got nothing to do now .\nC : they that's good .\nA : that's not bad , is it ?\nC : we all had our talk and we agree on several thing , on most on things .\nB : its the best remote ever .\nA : he's off again .\nA : but when start here , it's here .\nD : you just have to push harder .\nC : you have to push harder .\nA : so is it nope .\nB : yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand , and don't think that's .\nC : where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , .\nB : we can better draw design on this .\nB : but we can't .\nC : if if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw thing quick , and then before it goes off again .\nB : 'll stay here ?\nD : finish meeting now .\nA : finish the meeting now .\nA : alright now we to do , so message ?\nB : or we'll get the email .\nC : we can we get email here ?\nA : no , get away .\nA : you'll have to work on this one .\nB : 'll few seconds and then we'll get an email .\nA : that's good idea .\nD : have fun lads .\nC : happy hol happy holidays ."], ["<t> The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype. </t>  <t> It is rounded, with the front made of hard plastic in different colours. </t>  <t> The back, as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium. </t>  <t> The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle. </t>  <t> The buttons include oval digit buttons, arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those, is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button. </t>  <t> The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device. </t>  <t> After the presentation, the product was evaluated. </t>  <t> This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness, ease of use, finding the device when it is lost, hi-tech features, incorporation of fashion trends, and ergonomic design. </t>  <t> Because it was over budget, titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded. </t>  <t> They thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design. </t>  <t> Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied), leadership (the process was democratic, not happy with management), teamwork (happy with it), and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings). </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> Despite disagreement regarding the position of the LCD (top or bottom), the screen was left at the bottom as it was in the prototype. </t>  <t> The sample speaker was taken out to bring the cost of the prototype down to the original budget of 12.50 euros. </t>  <t> They also decided to replace titanium with similar-looking plastic for the same reason. </t>  <t> There was criticism for the shape of the remote (thicker at the ends, thinner at the middle). </t>  <t> The project manager still disagreed on the position of the LCD: he would prefer it to be at the top. </t>  <t> The total cost of the prototype was 18.6 euros. </t>  <t> The team had to discuss which features should be discarded. </t>  <t> The only way was to go to a regular chip, but that would mean losing the LCD screen, which was integral to the design. </t>  <t> Replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote. </t>  <t> The team discussed the possibility to leave the remaining cost at 14.10. </t>  <t> The SMARTboard was considered a disaster as they could not draw, and the digital pens can only be useful for drawings. </t>  <t> Some people thought that there was no advantage to using the SMARTboard instead of a normal blackboard and chalk, although you can save and reuse things with the former. </t> ", "B : we have to do what ?\nA : some extra deciding .\nA : 'll show you the notes again .\nA : you'll you two will present us your prototype .\nA : then that's your bit ?\nA : didn't see anything about it , so already thought you you were to do that .\nA : so the you're .\nA : i'll show you how we're going to do with financing this design .\nC : that's important too .\nA : and then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .\nA : because 'll see about the costs .\nA : we'll evaluate our our production and then we can close .\nA : the finance we'll do later , so firstly i'll show you the notes .\nA : don't t's very interesting .\nA : this is copy paste .\nC : from me , .\nA : you had some very strange layout .\nC : from us all , , from all of us .\nC : it's chorus , .\nA : we ge we went through the agenda , and had some some presentations from you three .\nA : and summarised what you said to us .\nA : so don't t's very interesting and go through it again .\nA : so this is what we decided .\nA : it's also copy paste from what we made together .\nA : so we still know that .\nA : and then we can we can use the time better .\nA : next you two will present the pot prototype for us .\nC : alright , we both will ?\nC : or one of us will ?\nB : no you go and i'll supplement you .\nC : if make mistakes you'll .\nC : this is our design .\nC : it's pretty much like mike draw drew the in the during the last meeting .\nC : with the different perspectives of it .\nC : we'll begin with the front .\nC : we have the the round shape the round basic shape .\nC : with the upper part being the front .\nC : so there's this part which is made of hard plastic , the front .\nC : and we're we're using different colours .\nC : for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\nC : but , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark .\nC : then we have the lower part of the of the device .\nC : which is part of the back actually , because it's also titanium .\nC : you can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under the under side of it , , the back side and the lower part of the front is titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour , the look .\nC : then we have on back on the front the logo in the upper corner , which is made which is also part of the back , part of the titanium titanium part .\nB : it's double , but it's double .\nC : the logo it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double logo is in there .\nB : but it's very difficult to to draw that in .\nC : so that's the logo in the upper lef corner .\nC : then we have the buttons .\nC : it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round oval will be better for the for the for the different channel buttons .\nC : so oval , those are here .\nC : and then we have the the the the con the the the , , the volume and the channel controls in the middle here .\nB : channel up and volume ?\nC : with arrow shapes , which makes it also bit more exciting than basic round or square buttons .\nC : and also here are the two buttons we on .\nC : we have the button .\nC : nei we the button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and volume changers .\nC : and then we've here the menu button and the and the video button .\nB : menu for the screen .\nC : and this low part , this is the screen .\nC : this is what we made of it .\nC : you can make suggestions if you want .\nA : look at it , the side the side view .\nB : at the back .\nC : we we should finish first our talk and then you can add suggestions .\nC : don't want to don't want to suppress you but i'll finish this quick .\nC : i've had everything on the front ?\nB : no the back .\nB : with the logo and our no don't think and the and about the side view this the front won't be as thick , but again the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really , it won't be visible .\nC : we thought about , the back is titanium .\nC : and we thought about the logo big in the middle .\nC : just so again the double .\nC : we have then the logo on front and on the back .\nC : that's too much but you have to say say that if you think that way .\nC : and the company slogan , we thought in arc shape above the logo .\nC : that's what we were thinking about , and and before forget .\nA : see , but .\nC : the the voice , , the voice recorder is at the bottom .\nC : and you can record it using , , the the the back of the device .\nA : when look at when look at this side view , when have that in my hand , it's terrible .\nA : if if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , then it that it lies over your hands .\nC : fits it it it it fits the hand , mean the the the the in the middle in the that's the question .\nA : but what what what what agree is that when when you have such of an arc in the middle , so that the the the ends and the fronts is bit thicker , so then it falls over your hands .\nB : if if you handle remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .\nB : you you have it bit .\nD : it depends on the size .\nD : if it's kinda small , this is is .\nD : but if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .\nA : and how large is it ?\nD : that's the question .\nC : what do you suggest we do ?\nC : this was mike's prototype , and you seemed to on it .\nA : the sides haven't seen yet , ?\nC : but now you have different .\nB : they lay there all the time .\nC : the size doesn't really matter side ?\nA : they the the the the the side view , we didn't .\nC : we we he drew the the side , but you you weren't paying attention as usual .\nC : any case , we'll discuss it now .\nC : this is pretty good good idea .\nD : agree with the screen .\nD : you have it in your palm like this , and you can watch watch the screen .\nD : and if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .\nC : but you you hold it like this .\nB : you you don't you don't grab it , you you .\nC : you're not holding it like this .\nC : you , , how do you call it ?\nC : you don't have it like this .\nC : you have it more like this .\nA : no no no .\nC : you you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .\nD : like you're holding your telephone .\nD : because if you have screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .\nC : so and you can you can grab it bit higher , so ll the the that's reason to to to put the screen on the upper side , but if necessary .\nB : that way , it it falls into your hand .\nD : agree on this .\nD : no , don't .\nD : that's not the point and you might be you might be target customer .\nB : no but but for as far as see , three of us agree and only nils but you're the project manager , you can make the hard decisions .\nA : if you if you three agree then then that's it .\nA : so , we'll we we'll do it like this .\nC : but are can you live with it ?\nC : you said it was unusable .\nA : alright , if you think that that's the way it should no no , when my personal taste is that want it to fall over my hands with thick but in the market no not .\nC : but do you but you don't think this is completely unusable .\nC : not , but you are also human .\nA : for me , wouldn't buy it .\nA : let's say it like that .\nC : we have to take every everyone into account .\nA : no yes but , we , but that's that's that's that's more market research .\nC : who who else thinks like you ?\nC : thousand people , or million people .\nA : so let it be like this at at this moment .\nC : let it be .\nC : so that's that .\nC : any other suggestions ?\nA : no , it's .\nB : but what about the redesigning ?\nA : comes to that later .\nA : you can walter .\nC : you're very personal again .\nA : you can do the evaluation criteria on this ?\nA : that's more useful than just speaking .\nD : this is just short intro .\nD : i'm going to do the ev evaluation .\nD : that's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .\nD : so made made few questions on the hand of the impor most important requirements and trends .\nD : and we have to look if our if our device is working correctly .\nD : put some questions in word file .\nD : see if find them .\nD : think you have all seen this evaluation , so don't have to explain it .\nD : the first question is , is the device good-looking ?\nD : because normal most people thought that earlier devices were ugly ugly .\nD : seventy five percent of them .\nD : so what do we think ?\nC : we designed it , so we are very .\nA : we're we're not quite objective about this .\nD : no , know , but have to evaluate it .\nB : designed it to be good-looking .\nD : so have to take this questionnaire .\nC : so and we ha we have answer now ?\nA : to the customers ?\nA : to potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?\nD : but 't can , but , we dis we di we designed it to be perfect .\nA : know , know , know .\nA : but can go , because of the time , pretty quick through this .\nA : do we find it good-looking ?\nC : it let's start with the beginning , just one by one .\nB : we designed it to be good-looking , so .\nD : so but we have to be critic critical about it .\nD : and have to take all these points and get average at the end .\nD : so we we know where we stand .\nD : 'cause there are some things we might have bi might have forgotten .\nA : so it's point four .\nA : easy to find two .\nD : is it good-looking ?\nC : it's it's it's pointed towards the youth , if you look at the design and and the colours and everything .\nC : that was our target audience .\nC : but it's also not completely unacceptable for older people .\nC : it's it's not device that , that's that's for older people , it's it's more that classical look .\nD : the titanium might be for older people .\nD : it you put put black front on it .\nC : they like black , but they'll they they think the the titanium look of it is also it's also good for them , so we both have consider considered the youth and also bit older people .\nC : so it's very good-looking and not only for youth young people .\nB : we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because how how many points there are but .\nA : we we have to get get on , go through this .\nC : is it easy to change channels ?\nD : so the last one is seven .\nD : easy to change channels ?\nB : no it's with two huge buttons .\nA : no , not false .\nA : have to go through it .\nC : it's as easy as can be made .\nC : you how can you make it any easier ?\nD : the power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?\nD : the device is easy to find if you lose it ?\nC : we we don't we don't have that .\nA : we didn't implement anything about that .\nB : t's easier to find than normal black one , because of the colour .\nB : but we have so few functions , so .\nC : don't have the device that beeps when you lost it or so , but .\nA : are the functions easy to learn ?\nA : we do want we have less of an and the device r_s_i_ sensitive ?\nB : should two , because the voice recorder is not self learning .\nA : but just do some we we this is too time consuming .\nC : are we take too much time ?\nA : not not towards you , but towards this all .\nA : this is we you have to put it to the customers .\nA : ll bit , so four .\nA : and features included also one .\nA : those nine is the fancy-looking .\nA : device fancy feeling .\nC : and fancy-feeling too , because of the titanium back .\nA : are there enough technology ?\nA : also we have two .\nA : is the device easy to use ?\nB : the two two .\nA : yes we have not many buttons .\nC : so two because of the voice recorder .\nD : with the three .\nA : two , three .\nA : are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?\nA : our covers , in our fronts .\nA : so yes , one .\nC : one or two .\nA : is the material attractive ?\nB : one or two , another two .\nD : if you look at this no .\nC : it doesn't really resemble any fruit , that's true .\nC : but but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours .\nD : three , alright .\nC : and you can also have front with with fruit on it .\nA : is the material attractive ?\nA : the titanium is strong , and the rest the buttons feel soft .\nA : so would say at least two .\nB : this is the last meeting ?\nA : yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me .\nD : the average will come later .\nC : knew things were going too smoothly .\nC : there had to be some trouble along the way .\nA : look at the costs at this point .\nA : had to fit it in .\nD : it has to go to twelve , ?\nA : twelve and half .\nD : twelve and half .\nA : so what costs lot ?\nA : the sample spea costs four .\nC : the tha that's that's bit an optional option .\nA : the sample speaker , the sensor .\nD : kick it out .\nA : kick it out .\nA : we have to go to twelve and half .\nA : the speaker costs far , by far the most .\nD : that's some wrong info , man .\nA : it it isn't worth it .\nC : no , no .\nA : we could make two different versions , one with and one without .\nD : it's it's just extra .\nA : but for this so , zero .\nD : kick it out .\nA : then we go to fourteen point six .\nA : the titanium don't want to lose actually .\nD : batteries are quite no , no no no .\nA : come on , remote control has battery .\nB : ll why why why should we use advanced chip ?\nC : have bit of problem .\nC : because the screen .\nA : be for the you had said .\nB : can't we do that with regular chip ?\nC : because that because my information says it .\nA : what what's the difference between simple and regular ?\nA : what's the difference between simple and regular chip ?\nB : regular is normal .\nC : read something about it , but , read something about it , but it wasn't very clear .\nC : didn't in include it in my report .\nA : what happens if we do how much do we win ?\nC : single you have to use chip .\nC : so you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the screen .\nB : we we we why ?\nB : we have very little options furthermore , for the have to put that in .\nC : but if you have regular chip , you can't have the screen .\nD : we need to have the the screen .\nC : that that's fact .\nA : we could say , this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , because the the fronts they will buy it .\nC : but it's only one half .\nD : no , but no , that's it's not relevant .\nA : the special colour .\nC : it it doesn't but we then we have to lose the screen .\nA : then you then you only have one half left .\nB : you must change the chip back .\nB : you must change the chip back , nils .\nD : no , then the whole concept is you you can make you can make it cheaper .\nC : know but that's what my information says .\nC : di didn't put the advanced chip in there for fun .\nB : no we you you we have an advanced chip-on-print , and we have an l_c_ display .\nC : you have to use it .\nD : but if you don't sell no no no no .\nB : that's bit double .\nB : we don't need both .\nA : no , the advanced chip is needed to have an display .\nC : for the screen .\nA : says , his that was in the second meeting , .\nC : and what do they mean with curves again ?\nC : because we you have uncurved .\nA : did single curve to you said double curved , he , because it's bit cheaper already .\nA : we can also make it flat .\nC : but what what did what do , but what do they mean with the curves ?\nC : is is this curve ?\nA : yes , that's curved .\nC : this is actually two curves , .\nC : it's how you it's how you look at it .\nA : no , it's one curve .\nA : one curve , simple .\nC : then we have huge problem .\nC : we can never get below the twelve and half .\nA : we have big financial problem .\nB : make it more expensive to buy .\nA : then we have two dollars less profit .\nA : come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to congratulate us , so by the way , we also have this one .\nD : if if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more .\nD : but because we we use brand at the front and dun at the back .\nC : but but you'll agree that that we that now we have this screen , it's it's very not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .\nD : if you have lots of marketing people might buy .\nB : or we could replace it why why don't we replace the titanium with plastic coloured titanium , titanium-coloured plastic ?\nD : if you if you make it to have , that's just .\nA : plastic is yes , but got it .\nC : that's pretty not very practical .\nD : that is pretty stupid .\nC : but i'm don't agree .\nA : you want to dump the titanium ?\nB : we we we have to get cheaper .\nA : and make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .\nB : but then we we've got to run through the eval evaluation process again .\nC : the titanium just provided the the tough look and the and the and also the the older people will like it because of that .\nA : then you have ugly , stupid , ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .\nB : it's not ugly looking .\nB : the looks remain the same .\nA : no , don't .\nA : and the feel , and that it is strong , and we still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one why can't i'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the lowest price you can make remote for that's trendy these days .\nC : and because alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's important for old people .\nC : the titanium is very important .\nB : but then we we won't get there .\nC : we have problem , .\nC : but you can better , , dump the screen then .\nB : we can dump the special colour .\nB : we we use plastic .\nB : and plastic is already in colour .\nD : don't think you should dump the screen .\nB : no , nothing .\nD : or you shou it's or change the titanium or dump the screen .\nD : but you could better change titanium to hard hard plastic looking like titanium than lose the screen .\nD : because you have lots of functions in it too .\nC : agree with that .\nB : but no no no no .\nC : so we we use unfortunately .\nC : so titanium-coloured plastic for the back .\nA : i'll talk to the managers .\nB : titanium stays there .\nA : titanium , thi this this is this is really good re remote .\nC : this is good , but it it's not good enough .\nD : osl if you don't have the money , you can't make it .\nA : but those those account managers , what do what do they know ?\nC : so we have to use the ditch the titanium , i'm afraid .\nB : no because we did not know anything about it .\nC : what do we what do we know ?\nC : all we want is is fancy design but we don't really consider the costs .\nA : yes , yes .\nC : so al alright , .\nA : one and half euros .\nC : but we have to deal with it now .\nD : so if you don't have the money , you can't make it .\nC : so so titanium gone and add plastic .\nD : so this is too expensive .\nD : so we have to make it cheaper .\nB : but then we've got money left .\nC : and on plastic times two and then we are there ?\nA : no it's just all plastic .\nC : no no six .\nC : lot of plastic , .\nD : it's just free , man .\nA : so but then we can add the special colour ?\nC : no two for the to make it clear .\nA : as we have money over left .\nA : and we still have money left .\nB : the case is double curved then .\nA : what do we want , ?\nC : want gold plating .\nC : no no we have we have to fill we ha no no no , but that's not you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium .\nB : because you have that curve and you have that curve .\nB : we have curves in all directions .\nD : that that is the problem .\nC : and that we dropped , so it it can be done .\nC : but it's pretty funny .\nC : we we do want to reach twelve point five .\nC : but it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .\nB : this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .\nC : we get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve twelve and half .\nA : we have to dump our titanium , and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of project , project .\nA : satisfaction on , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?\nC : can't get no satisfaction , but it's in if we consider the costs then this is the best , .\nA : it's terrible that we got those costs at the last moment .\nA : that's really bad .\nC : its it's ridiculous actually , but which isn't very practical , but that's the way .\nA : but that that that's that , that's reason , but also for our creativity .\nA : we had design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .\nB : we we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs .\nD : t's it was very democratic .\nA : al i've filled that in in the questionnaires each time , so the managers were terrible .\nA : so , with their all their useless requirements .\nA : but alright , the teamwork ?\nC : they they didn't think of the requirements .\nC : it's the requirements of the user , .\nA : no they said , we won't we won't use teletext , we won't use the d_v_d_ .\nC : but they base that on on the user specifications .\nA : alright , teamwork ?\nA : what do you , what did you think about the smartboard ?\nC : it was complete disaster .\nC : no it it it it is no it's other way around .\nD : don't like it .\nA : t's also it's both the smartboards .\nB : no , that's smartboard , and that's digital pen .\nC : that's the smartboard .\nC : that's the digital panel .\nA : liked this smartboard , but hated that one .\nD : this this this isn't smartboard , ?\nA : t's both smartboard .\nC : that's that's the smart televi .\nD : but you this is just large large television .\nB : they're both smartboards .\nD : you you use the , but you ca this is just beamer function .\nA : it's both smartboard , but this one is used for desktop , and that one is used to to draw .\nD : and here , on this one , you can draw the pictures and things like that .\nA : wi which one did you like ?\nD : but that one .\nD : that one isn't accurate .\nD : it just doesn't work .\nD : you can , but there's big distinction between the these don't need smartboard .\nB : but this is meant by the digital pen .\nA : that is so .\nC : didn't use nei it it's much but you can sent it about three times now .\nA : we're now talking about the smartboards .\nB : we used that one , and we needed it .\nD : but give me beamer .\nD : that's that's much much cheaper .\nB : but like that one , but that one is terrible .\nA : or install laptop to beamer , or have this one standing here in an like it .\nC : green board with chalk is much more useful than that thing .\nC : the simple sch school board .\nA : so and the digi the digital pen ?\nA : did did you like that one ?\nC : didn't use it .\nC : wrote things down but didn't import it into my laptop .\nA : used it just to check it out , but you you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on page for yourself , and then you're going to send it , .\nC : that's the but also you write things down .\nD : it isn't practical .\nC : and you can also bring your your your note block .\nC : so what's the what's the what's the point of importing it into .\nA : it's , no , it it's useless .\nB : and made mistake .\nB : but it it would have been useful , if could show this on the screen .\nA : for drawings , yes .\nC : for drawings , but not for personal notes .\nC : that's not very you can bring your paperwork along and if you have lot of paper if you've if you've understand .\nA : but but for notes , it you you have to put that in strict you have to put name , standard date , and all those things .\nD : it might be useful for drawings .\nD : agree on that .\nA : and notes for meeting are very strict .\nA : so if you were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to word .\nA : so it doesn't doesn't have any .\nD : that stefan use .\nC : but this option is only useful if you've got lot of paperwork .\nC : you can't it's not very ni lot of documents are .\nD : no , don't .\nD : it's it's only useful if you have to draw something .\nB : but then it's really useful , .\nC : can we keep them ?\nD : wireless wireless things .\nA : other things we used here ?\nA : hated the cameras , hated the microphones .\nD : these chairs , man .\nA : but no no .\nC : did you really did you really take take those in account ?\nC : half of time didn't notice they were there .\nA : haven't looked one time directly at the camera .\nC : so but we shouldn't talk about that .\nA : don't care about it .\nC : because this is realistic environment .\nA : etcetera we new ideas found ?\nA : what ideas for future schedule what ?\nA : for future meetings you have got ?\nB : missed the option to to email , .\nD : communicate in between .\nB : email or chat .\nA : chatting and emailing .\nC : that's just the the environment they set us up with .\nC : so , for drawing for drawings .\nB : but that's one new idea .\nA : new ideas found by this .\nD : more more information in the beginning .\nA : we don't want this .\nA : we hate this .\nD : that's for people who sketch the whole day , imagine that it's useful .\nA : digital pen is useless .\nB : no it isn't .\nA : so , for drawings .\nB : so it isn't useless .\nA : but two but then you have to have lot of drawings , because if had company and i'm going to buy those expensive huge expensive things , and have to pay those papers that are expensive , i'm not going to then still they they they should have graphics programme on the laptop .\nC : no but it's still an expensive expensive but if .\nA : because this is huge this very very expensive paper .\nB : you you can't you can't draw on laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand .\nB : with the mouse it is no .\nC : and if and but what if this this board smartboard is malfunctioning or someone .\nD : mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching .\nC : but suppose it was working correctly , what would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ?\nA : hated to draw like that .\nA : you you can't draw anything neat .\nD : but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , , very precise , mu it saves time .\nC : anything you want .\nA : if it if it would be perfect following .\nA : then still it's it's it's very expensive towards just green school board .\nC : isn't , but that thing is is , board , school board , .\nB : but but then you can save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and .\nC : it has it is useful .\nC : this if it works correct , this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .\nC : so if we get in if we get another one and you make it does work , then it's pretty useful .\nC : because you can draw things quickly and clearly for anyone in the discussion room .\nC : and then you can save it immediately .\nA : they are now .\nA : so , congratulations crew .\nC : did you type that ?\nA : se finally my beer .\nB : we can go to the bar and with our newly earned money .\nA : how long we still have .\nA : how long we had for this last meeting .\nA : but , it is bit still have to make the end report and all those things .\nC : till four o'clock ?\nA : have to do that .\nD : you better get started .\nA : di did you save this one in the folder ?\nA : can you do that ?\nB : no no no no .\nC : no we must save this thing , .\nC : in the shared map map .\nB : but nils you've got some work left .\nA : what you have to do .\nC : map , is it good word ?\nC : the folder , .\nB : have to go to physiotherapy .\nA : two times quick .\nC : so it is useful , .\nB : it is handy .\nC : no but radical .\nD : i'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom .\nC : do you believe it yourself ?\nA : he saved them all ten .\nB : they they wanted everything we produced , so my big bird .\nC : they also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and your big beautiful bird .\nA : where is this ?\nC : the pen is just broken and the board isn't .\nC : of or the other way around so too .\nD : you are broken .\nB : you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready .\nA : she already knows .\nC : who is she you're talking about ?\nC : you mean our coach , our personal coach .\nC : is she also our accountant ?\nC : is she responsible for sending that information so late ?\nB : close your laptop .\nC : because then we have to confront her with our .\nB : so she can see we're ready .\nA : we put the fashion in electronics , but we couldn't because of the costs .\nB : let's take this remote into production .\nA : that that's the title of our end document .\nC : that that's our new slogan .\nA : we couldn't put the fashion into the electronics .\nC : blame our accountants .\nC : but we couldn't , .\nD : i'm management would like that .\nB : she's on the move ."], ["<t> For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the

the opening , then the rest .\nA : what are we going to do .\nA : we have to make new remote control .\nA : it has to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\nA : so we will get back on that .\nA : first we have to make functional design .\nA : after that we have to make conceptual design , and then after that detailed design .\nA : so we'll discuss that later .\nA : first we have look at .\nA : so first to we have to make small painting .\nA : what have do we have to do .\nA : first you can save the documents .\nA : we have to do that every time we make something .\nA : you can print it .\nA : and we have to use the pen and the eraser .\nA : we all have to use this one .\nA : you have to make your own favourite animal .\nA : so i'll make an example .\nA : first don't touch that things .\nA : you can use the pen .\nA : and then you can make something .\nA : you can change some things .\nA : format , line , and change it .\nA : and you can change the colour .\nA : so that's it .\nA : so so and after it you have to save it .\nA : now we can make new one .\nA : you have to paint now .\nA : so you're next .\nD : where it going ?\nA : what is going on ?\nA : what are you what ?\nC : what is this , pictionary .\nA : is it is it is duck .\nD : so now save ?\nA : blank , yes .\nB : let's try this .\nD : i'm not getting anything on my screen now .\nC : he did it before .\nB : no , no .\nA : so you can always go back .\nA : so that's it .\nA : so that was two .\nA : the we will sell the at twenty five euros .\nA : and we have only twenty of twelve and half euro to make it .\nA : so now we have to think about what we will make .\nA : first wanna hear from you .\nA : what are your experiences with remote controls .\nC : big one , they are not easy to use .\nC : have one set and remote control , when dropped it , it broke .\nC : so that won't be our goal , .\nC : and big buttons , that's easier to use than .\nC : not all the small buttons , you big buttons , positive .\nA : is this positive or negative , that big buttons ?\nC : all all small buttons like when you have like hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't they're working for .\nA : what are your experiences ?\nB : the the the goal of remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the t_v_ set .\nB : and that it controls the channels and the the volume .\nB : and it's positive if there's led led on the corner of the of the remote .\nB : so that it it still has batteries on it in it .\nB : and that if you push the button the led gives light , and and you see that it's working .\nB : but no no no .\nA : so and do they always have that ?\nB : but my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that .\nA : it's easy to you .\nD : at home we have t_v_ , video recorder , d_v_d_ player , and satellite receiver .\nD : we have four distinctive remote controls for that .\nD : that's not really ea easy .\nD : so it would be if we have one for all .\nD : and we also had remote control for our radio set .\nD : but it it had lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what .\nD : and it was not easy to use .\nD : so we barely used it .\nA : so they have too much .\nA : for our own remote control we have to think how do we make it .\nA : so what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ?\nA : what what does it have to have ?\nC : not not too heavy .\nA : not too heavy .\nC : not much buttons .\nC : that when you drop it , it won't break .\nC : like some rubber on it .\nC : or hard hard plastic .\nC : buttons not too small .\nC : something like when you lose your remote control , sometimes it happen .\nC : it between the couch and you can't find it .\nC : when you push but button on the t_v_ , then you hear some some bleep .\nC : and then you , there there's remote control .\nA : so , that's .\nB : that's that are good ideas .\nB : the led on the corner , that that indicates that it's working .\nB : if you push button .\nB : and looking on the budget , not too expensive material .\nB : so probably plastic .\nD : it from marketing point of view , it also has to look .\nD : or you won't sell it .\nD : and on our website we can see what products we already have .\nD : and it should work with as many as possible of them .\nA : this is it has to be compatible with other things .\nC : have one more idea .\nC : just popped up .\nC : it it won't take lot of batteries .\nC : so you don't won't have to change the batteries once week or once every two weeks .\nA : no battery use .\nA : so more ideas ?\nA : it's only the first ideas .\nA : so what are we going to do now is next meeting is in half an hour .\nA : next meeting , half an hour .\nA : what you have to do .\nA : look on your .\nA : and next instructions you'll get in your email .\nA : so this is the first meeting .\nA : see you later in half an hour ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes

", "A : so welcome back .\nA : what do do we have to do ?\nA : want to say i'm the secretary , so make the minutes .\nA : you find them in your in the map in the from the group .\nA : there's the minutes from the first meeting .\nA : you'll find the next minutes also there .\nA : then wanna hear from you , what you've done .\nA : and after that have some new product requirements .\nA : so and after that we have to make decisions , what we will do .\nA : and then we're ready .\nA : we have forty minutes for this meeting .\nA : after that we'll have lunch .\nA : so first wanna ask the industrial designer to tell what he did .\nC : that's my task .\nA : so on your computer , or the what's the name ?\nC : i've where have put it ?\nC : my documents or not ?\nC : i've save it on my computer , my presentation .\nC : it was about the working of the remote control .\nA : what's the name of it ?\nA : it's the technical function or the functional requirements .\nC : the working design .\nC : but i've saved it .\nC : but now where it is .\nA : what is this ?\nC : and import this until one more .\nA : on the desktop .\nC : what the fuck is this ?\nA : nah , nah , nah .\nC : that's the empty one .\nA : and presentation of working design .\nC : here it is .\nC : little later but here it is .\nA : so now have ten minutes to tell it .\nC : it's little difficult what i'm gonna tell you .\nC : it's about the working of the remote control .\nC : had an half an hour to study it and don't get it .\nC : ten minutes to tell it .\nC : it will be few minutes and first will tell you something about the findings , what discovered about the remote control .\nC : the working bout it of it .\nC : then i'll have some map , and it's the top of the remote control .\nC : with little bit of science , you will show that in in few minutes .\nC : and then what i'll think about it .\nC : first , the findings .\nC : the remote control is very difficult thing to to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen remote control inside .\nC : there's lot of plastic on it , because its not so expensive .\nC : and there are lot of wires , which connect the components in it , the battery , and there are switches and things like that .\nC : there's lot of small electronics .\nC : so it won't be too expensive to build it .\nC : only twelve euro fifty we will make it .\nC : now and here have the top of the remote control .\nC : here's some chip .\nC : on top of this , there are the numbers .\nC : you have all on your remote control .\nC : and the teletext button .\nC : and here's the battery .\nC : and when you push the button , it will will be sent to the chip .\nC : and the chip will send it to all sub-components .\nC : that's what said , it's very difficult .\nC : and after that it will be sent to the infrared .\nC : and that will send it to your television .\nC : that's short how it works .\nC : make it difficult , but we all we all don't get it .\nC : it's it won't be we shouldn't make it too big .\nC : also for the cost , we should only put one battery on it .\nC : also for the cost , use only plastic .\nC : not other materials .\nC : also because of the cost , not too much buttons on it .\nC : we can also make button with menu button .\nC : and then that that you will see it on the t_v_ .\nC : and on the t_v_ you can switch into the menu .\nC : that's it's easier .\nC : and the bleep signal , you told us .\nC : but we can also use it bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is bleep .\nC : then you'll have to change it in in week .\nC : and also the bleep , when what told you about when you lost it , and you push button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it .\nC : this is just .\nA : you say one battery is cheaper .\nC : if we if we use only just one small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .\nA : but when you use two , you can use it two times longer .\nC : but then we'll have to make the remote control long lasting .\nA : so it's the size of the remote control .\nA : and the buttons .\nA : when you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it .\nC : but this our remote control is for the televisions we we sell in our company ?\nC : or is it also for other company for other televisions ?\nA : we have to use it also on other televisions though .\nC : then this is an option .\nA : so but don't it they are two different things though .\nC : just menu button to use it on our televisions .\nC : and then we make it easier for our televisions .\nC : and on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the ?\nA : we have to choose one .\nA : it has to work on all televisions .\nC : then the menu button will only work on the newer televisions .\nC : and we will look forward and don't make remote control which for the older televisions .\nC : and have one more idea .\nC : it's one of your tasks .\nC : but , to have trendy remote control , we can also make something like the nokia mobile phones .\nC : to change covers .\nC : so if you have trendy half with all red , yellow and something .\nC : and then you can put red cover on it .\nC : and also different things .\nD : will this will this add to the cost ?\nC : then it won't be will have just one cover on the original one .\nC : and then you can buy the covers .\nD : yes but you have to be able to change it .\nD : does it make it more difficult to design ?\nC : it will be little more difficult , but not too much .\nC : just like with the nokia mobile phones .\nA : but there are much more nokia telephones than these ones .\nC : but then we'll have to to just put five covers on it , and see if it works .\nC : if it won't works then we'll get something else .\nC : then we won't go further with it .\nA : but are their profits bigger than their cost ?\nC : cover made in in china , it it won't be so expensive .\nA : but there are also design cost .\nA : don't think when you have remote control , do you change the cover ?\nA : would you change the cover ?\nC : but trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and the the children think , this is my remote control , made picture on it .\nA : but that too less people would change it for good profit .\nA : so yes it is but don't think we have to do it .\nC : and the other people ?\nC : what do you think about it ?\nB : it's good idea .\nB : but if if it , don't i'm not if it will make profit enough to but it's it's original idea .\nC : you're the project manager .\nA : so now the user interface designer .\nB : yes shall give short talk about the the technical function design .\nB : the the the technical function design was to for remote control to to to have some influence on the t_v_ set .\nB : both audio and vide video in cordless way .\nB : no cords attached .\nB : and , it all by pushing button on the remote .\nB : that was from my own experience and and the previous meeting .\nB : find some some interesting quotes on the web .\nB : the same idea here .\nB : message to the television .\nB : and and and and basic operations like on and off , and switching channels , and and teletext like that .\nB : these are two remotes , and that's our our dilemma .\nB : we just heard from the industrial designer how difficult it is .\nB : but shall we make basic remote control , just swapping channels and volume and power button and nothing much more .\nB : or more functions on the remote .\nB : more devices you can influence .\nB : radio or video recorder , v_c_r_ .\nB : that's our dilemma .\nB : any ideas about that ?\nB : basic or multifunctional ?\nA : we'll got back on that later .\nB : the that was just on my mind .\nB : so didn't what way we would go .\nB : that was my functional talk .\nA : then it's your turn , the marketing expert .\nD : this bit too far .\nD : so so i'm gonna have presentation about the market , about what people think .\nD : we did usability lab-test with hundred persons .\nD : and we looked at several things .\nD : among them design , how did they like the use of it , what frustrations they had while using remote controls .\nD : what what will be our market .\nD : and we asked them if we had some new featu features .\nD : if that would be good idea or not .\nD : our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls .\nD : they especially found found them very ugly .\nD : and they also found them hard to to learn how to use it .\nD : they also zap lot .\nD : so zapping should be very easy .\nD : and fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons .\nD : so lot of unused buttons .\nD : there is more findings .\nD : on the buttons .\nD : which buttons find users very important and which which not ?\nD : and how much would they use them ?\nD : the most used button is the channel selection .\nD : and we asked them how relevant they think the buttons are .\nD : the power , volume and channel selections are very relevant .\nD : teletext is less relevant but also important .\nD : not important they found the audio , that's not the volume but specific the the pitch , or the left or .\nD : the screen and the brightness .\nD : and channel settings .\nD : and they also are not used very often .\nD : then we have few graphs about the market .\nD : here we can see what the market share is of several groups .\nD : as you can see , most users are between thirty six and forty five .\nD : the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big .\nD : and to come back on the the swapping things , don't think , the younger will be most interest in it .\nD : but they are not very big group .\nD : in the we asked them , how would you like new feature .\nD : if you have an on the remote control , what would you think of it .\nD : now you can clearly see young users say .\nD : will that would very .\nD : and older user think they will be scared of change .\nD : and they won't like it .\nD : and another thing , how would you like to have speech recognition on it .\nD : here we see the same .\nD : young users think that's an interesting idea .\nD : and old users not .\nD : found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim .\nD : the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five .\nD : they are highly interested in the features , as you can see here .\nD : and they are more critical on their money spending .\nD : the second group is the older group .\nD : aged between forty six and sixty five .\nD : they are less interested in new features .\nD : but they spend their money more easily .\nD : now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about sixty percent .\nD : and the second group about forty percent .\nD : so the the first group is bigger .\nD : then come to my personal preferences .\nD : the first question is also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .\nD : saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it .\nD : but less of them will buy it .\nD : what , even young people say it's hard to use , remote control .\nD : so if you make remote control that is very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even the young group will also be more interested .\nD : and we can make special features .\nD : but it looks in the first time .\nD : but when use it , what's good thing of speech recognition .\nD : that's my second point .\nD : less important functions should be discarded from the remote control .\nD : it's about discussion we had earlier .\nD : you can find most functions on t_v_ set .\nD : so you don't have to have lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness .\nD : and such things .\nD : the design is very important .\nD : one thing did not say , is that lot of users also said then would buy good looking remote control if there will be one .\nD : but they found most remote controls very ugly .\nD : so the design of our remote control is very important .\nD : and it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .\nD : that were my findings .\nC : have one question .\nC : if we aim for the younger people , and there will be lot of features like or the the the speech recognising , the cost will be lot of lot higher .\nC : we don't have that in our budget .\nC : do you think ?\nB : and don't don't think twenty five euros for remote is really cheap .\nB : so it's , it's hard to get the younger group .\nA : the is cheaper than speech recognition .\nA : so that can be an good option .\nA : so but we'll come back on that .\nA : now , go on .\nA : what we go back on the decisions later .\nA : now we have few new product requirements .\nA : first , teletext .\nA : we have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore .\nA : so not necessary .\nA : only for the television .\nA : so we don't look at the other things like the radio .\nA : only the television .\nA : we look at the age group of forty plus .\nA : no , younger than forty .\nA : is big group , and like you showed , not very much people buy our .\nA : our corporate colour and slogan must be used .\nA : very important for the design .\nA : so you can see it on our site .\nA : we have to make our decisions , what we want to do .\nA : so like you said , we need the .\nA : it's good to put it in document .\nA : now we have to decide what controls do we need .\nA : so you can tell us .\nD : we can first have discussion on the the product requirements you just said .\nD : the the requirements you just said , we should first have discussion about that .\nA : yes , it's .\nD : personally think teletext is good option .\nD : not everyone who is looking t_v_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .\nA : but we don't use it .\nA : it's new requirement .\nA : so , it's not my requirement .\nC : we'll just have to do that .\nA : we have to do this .\nC : no discussion about it .\nA : so what controls do we need ?\nB : the separate channels .\nB : so but then both the the separate channels .\nB : so so zero to nine .\nA : channel zero to nine .\nA : it's easy to pick .\nA : what was your one ?\nD : it's the functional requirements .\nA : we had no no no no .\nA : where was that example of the johan .\nA : that was the the the the the technical hallo .\nA : what do we need ?\nA : zero to nine .\nC : to change to the next channel , just one button .\nC : to move up , move down .\nA : that's the channel .\nD : do we make menu ?\nA : yes the newer televisions ha do have menus .\nD : it will be quite easy to use , to have four arrows .\nA : the only one or two numbers .\nA : that's ch yes .\nD : up-down for channel selection , and left-right for volume .\nD : and menu button .\nD : and if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons .\nD : but the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .\nA : on the screen , you mean ?\nD : that depends on if you have the menu on the t_v_ .\nD : or you get the menu on the screen on the remote control .\nA : t's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions .\nA : so we need yes .\nC : but then we come to the costs .\nA : but if we have this so now we don't have lot of buttons .\nD : but you aim at the younger market , as they as as we seen in the usability lab , they will buy looking remote control .\nD : and also to find the easy to use part very important .\nD : so if we have sh screen , and not too many buttons , that will incre even when it's bit more cost , it will still sell .\nA : is this enough ?\nA : in the menu ?\nB : but then it's always more than one thing to do .\nA : then that's all .\nA : this will be the buttons .\nA : and that's enough for the next phase .\nA : so we can go on to yes .\nC : but now we have only the buttons .\nC : and we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ?\nA : no that's for the next phase .\nA : phase two is the conceptual design .\nA : so then we'll have the concepts .\nA : that's for the so next point .\nA : now we have lunch-break .\nA : after that we have thirty minutes for work .\nA : and you can find the minutes in the project documents folder inclusive the buttons .\nA : your individual action , you can find them in the email .\nA : so now it's time for lunch ."], ["<t> The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept,

now have my screen back too .\nA : we have presentations .\nA : so first , it's your turn .\nA : isn't it amazing .\nB : yes , let's talk about the interface concept .\nB : first i'll i'll discuss the buttons we just chose , show you some samples , discuss some colours and design , already .\nB : and my personal preferences .\nB : chose the power button to switch the television on and off .\nB : the bu the mute button to switch the volume on and on and off .\nB : the channels buttons , one to nine , and off zero to nine , and the button to choose higher channels than nine .\nB : the volume and channel quadrants , left and , up and down arrows , to do the volume and channel .\nB : and the menu menu button to man manipulate the display .\nB : found some interesting samples .\nB : what's pretty standard is that it's that they're all pretty high .\nD : lot lot of buttons buttons .\nB : large and and and pretty thin and and long .\nB : power buttons are mostly at the top left or .\nB : see the the the same arrows .\nB : and , arrow buttons can be blue .\nB : and what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons .\nB : some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that .\nB : but , these we we have to choose the icons , or or letters .\nB : this is the v_ for volume , but they're both v_ .\nB : so it's it's not really very clear what's the function of that .\nB : so , that's , .\nA : can you go back one page ?\nA : for the menu , what do we use for that ?\nA : we don't have buttons for the menu .\nA : or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .\nB : that was our idea .\nB : so , how like this .\nA : but you have to put it on the .\nB : or or this .\nB : and that the menu button is .\nA : but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\nB : so the the icons on the arrows , as , you mean .\nA : the second one .\nB : that's something to think about .\nC : i'll have something in my presentation .\nC : and you will see it .\nB : don't if we have to discuss this already , or in the next meeting .\nB : but , as we have to to to design the the case and the whole remote control in our our our corporate company colours and the logo , would recommend yellow case .\nB : the logo at the bottom .\nB : and , each each set of buttons has has his own colour .\nB : so , it's good .\nA : not too much colours .\nB : not too much .\nB : but no , no , no .\nA : no , it's not flower power .\nB : but this has to be has to be trendy and and , so good good icons on the buttons , and and big buttons is my personal opinion .\nB : that was that .\nA : so , you're next .\nC : i'm next , .\nC : here we go .\nC : at first we will will say something about what younger people want , our group we want to sell our remote controls to .\nC : and then , i'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about what battery is in it , what buttons also .\nC : first , the younger people , they want like soft mat materials and primary colours .\nC : like , yellow , red .\nC : so it's visible .\nC : the shapes are curved and round , like you also said .\nC : it's to get remote control not like all the other ones , straight and flat and long .\nC : but to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use like that .\nC : but that's just an idea .\nC : and then , i'll have to discuss about the costs of all the things for the remote control .\nC : the battery , there are few options .\nC : the best option is to use the basic battery .\nC : so , everybody can buy it at the at the supermarket .\nC : or use kinetic battery like within watch .\nC : when you shake it few times , it it's loaded .\nC : the the form of the remote control , it's also have it curved .\nC : and like it's hand-shaped .\nC : so you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons .\nC : material , you use plastic .\nC : hard plastic because it won't have to burst like in the in one time .\nC : and also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research .\nC : we have one new thing discovered .\nC : it's scroll push thing like mouse .\nC : it's easy to use for the channels .\nC : when you want to go move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , if you wanna see that channel .\nC : and also for the mouse , for the volume , it's also easy to use .\nC : just scroll bit up , scroll bit down .\nC : and that's also easy just when you have thing like this , and you get it here .\nC : you can do it with your thumb .\nC : and with your left hand you can push the buttons if you push channel one , you can see channel one .\nC : the electrics with scroll push button , we must use regular chips .\nC : there are also simple chips .\nC : they are cheaper .\nC : but then we have just basic remote control , and there are lot of those things , and people won't buy it any more .\nC : they have seen enough of it .\nC : and you have also advanced chips .\nC : but that's with the screen .\nC : and the costs will increase lot more .\nC : and our budget is too low to use and an , and the chip who is more expensive .\nC : and it's also then thoughtful if we use as different shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours .\nC : like , you get yellow remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera .\nC : you have any more questions about this ?\nC : the main thing is we look at the costs .\nC : and not too basic , not basic remote control , who everybody already has .\nD : but , thi this is with an ?\nD : no , not .\nC : not with an .\nA : no , isn't .\nA : but the is easy when you use the scroll buttons .\nA : then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .\nC : but then , what say , the costs will get lot higher .\nA : but then it's not easy to use scroll wheel .\nC : then you'll see it on the television .\nA : if you don't , yes .\nA : then you go one down one up .\nA : when you scroll .\nC : but when you see menu on the television , it's like you see one to twenty , you go scroll up , and push number tw twenty .\nA : but like we said before , it has to be used on every television .\nA : so you may not be no .\nA : the television must do that .\nA : so but young people have to have all their room .\nC : the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our remote control .\nA : and mostly they are smaller .\nA : so most the times that are not advanced televisions .\nC : but that won't be problem .\nC : no , but then we'll get to the regular remote controls .\nC : and , what said , everybody has them has them already .\nC : and they go to supermarket and buy them for two euros .\nC : and ge and get the most cheapest thing .\nC : and we must look further to to devel develop something news .\nD : can you give an indication in in the cost difference between the chip with or without ?\nC : got it on my screen and it was higher .\nC : but how much higher .\nD : 'cause it if we have an , it will also sell lot better .\nD : and that might bring back the costs .\nC : but then we'll we must discuss who what will be better .\nC : if we have better shape of the remote control , or better options on it .\nC : with scroll menu , scroll thing , and .\nC : and then flat remote control .\nC : or , more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without .\nA : you can look how how much it is for the .\nC : look on my note that the push-button requires simple chip chip .\nA : it's very important .\nC : scroll wheel requires minimally regular chip , which is higher price range .\nC : the display requires advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .\nA : but how much ?\nC : that's from my manufacturing division .\nD : so , my presentation is about trend-watching .\nD : did some trend-watching .\nD : it's very important to keep up with latest trends .\nD : 'cause if you don't , you won't sell .\nD : so , how we did do that ?\nD : made an investigation of the market , by trendwatchers .\nD : they watch in cities like paris and milan .\nD : known for their trend trends .\nD : and , what did you find ?\nD : we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich .\nD : and the young and trendy , they they starting to like fruit and vegetables as theme for clothes , shoes , and also products .\nD : and , material ?\nD : that should feel have spongy feeling .\nD : and to get feeling for what it is , here is an image of it .\nD : then the old and rich .\nD : they like dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .\nD : and , they also like familiar material , especially wood .\nD : now , another picture .\nD : to get feeling for this .\nD : then already come to my personal preferences .\nD : we aim at the younger market .\nD : so , we should also be look at their trends .\nD : however , with trends it's always if there's it's now .\nD : it it it might last one year , and next year it be can be different .\nD : and we want to sell our product for longer than one year .\nD : so , we must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be different next year .\nD : so , that's one thing to keep in mind .\nA : so now , it's , let's see .\nA : now , we have to decide , we have to decide on the concept .\nA : so , we have to look at 's next .\nA : components and user interface concept .\nA : so now , we have to make some concept .\nA : one of you can paint it on the board .\nA : first , user interface .\nC : how how we how we make it ?\nC : shouldn't we first discuss about like what we all , but if paint with more like something like 't dr 't draw it .\nA : yes , concept on just , but we can paint it .\nA : what do we want ?\nA : something like this ?\nA : or shapes or what do we need ?\nD : can make several concepts .\nD : we have this , and we had the idea of an more like sh in the shape of your hand .\nA : and you have to .\nC : i'm not designer .\nC : it's more three d_ .\nC : like , when you have part here .\nC : this is the remote control .\nC : and then you have something like this under it .\nC : so , it's easier to get it like this .\nC : it's like gun .\nA : so , it has to be soft ?\nC : and it has to be soft , .\nC : so , you can squeeze in it and ?\nA : and , the buttons ?\nC : buttons on top of it .\nC : you can do it with your thumb .\nB : but but that's the only scroll button on it then ?\nC : but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here .\nA : no , it won't .\nC : one till zero till nine .\nA : but , there one for the sound and one for the channels .\nB : but but how .\nC : or two buttons .\nD : and if we go to but if we have me .\nA : two scroll wheels .\nC : if if we do if we use one , then we'll have just switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back with the menu button .\nA : that's that's more difficult .\nA : it's better in but if we don't have we don't have menu .\nD : if we have menu , how do we choose other options ?\nC : and then you also can scroll scroll in it .\nC : just not like all the other ones , with this thing , and here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow .\nC : because , from hundred remote controls , ninety nine have it .\nC : then we have it on the t_v_ , the menu .\nA : but again how do we know the t_v_ can handle it ?\nA : so , there's no menu .\nC : it's like some teletext option , but we don't have teletext .\nA : so you can't use it .\nC : and if we put an thing on it , then the costs will be much higher .\nA : we make two concepts .\nC : but you all like this thing .\nC : with the scroll button .\nA : but that's one .\nC : and and this one has to be soft .\nC : and this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst .\nC : or some rubber around it .\nB : and you can and you can make the the power button as trigger .\nB : like just to , like .\nA : but when you handle it , you put it on and off .\nA : it's not good to use .\nA : but i'll zap .\nA : no , it's not good .\nA : now , second concept .\nA : one with , one without .\nA : then paint it .\nC : with the scroll thing on , like this ?\nA : one with two scroll buttons and one with without .\nA : one with with menu , and one without menu .\nA : and the one with with menu has an .\nA : do have to do everything .\nA : you have not so difficult .\nB : but if you put push the the menu button , wh what yes , but you which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .\nA : that's the menu .\nA : there for the screen .\nA : you have to for the menu .\nA : one that way .\nA : and one that way .\nA : so then it depends on the cost .\nA : on and off .\nC : but is it easy to use ?\nC : when you have it on your left side , and separate , more separate , .\nA : when it's not too big .\nA : just like phone .\nD : it's better if the scroll-wheels are more separate , .\nD : like , you have the menu button in between .\nC : on the left scroll button , and on the scroll button .\nC : but would it be easy to use then ?\nC : if it's like you have big also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .\nA : is it better ?\nA : when you the menu , you have to go there there there there .\nC : they were like round curves , different , , .\nA : that's that's the outside .\nA : but now the first the buttons .\nD : think we have we have now two buttons missing .\nD : the the mute button .\nD : we have two buttons missing .\nD : the mute button .\nD : and , the to to have to numbers .\nA : and the other .\nA : not so difficult .\nC : personally , two scroll buttons aren't easy to handle .\nA : but how do you wanna solve it ?\nC : with the switch button .\nA : but on the menu that's not easy .\nA : then you go down , you switch , you go into the , you switch , you go down .\nC : no like , you mean like that .\nC : then you can also have like , and joystick , .\nA : but is it does that break , joystick ?\nA : or small one just like in laptop .\nC : like in laptop , some thing .\nC : little bit bigger , with easier thi .\nA : mean , it's better .\nA : but how expensive it is ?\nA : why do pay you for ?\nC : or no scroll things .\nC : and no , no .\nA : for the young peoples scroll button's good .\nC : it won't work .\nA : so think we have to keep them .\nC : or remote control more like joystick .\nA : but is it that's not expensive than joystick is better .\nC : small one like this , like nintendo playstation thing .\nA : no just like in laptop .\nA : small , round .\nA : then it's not so big .\nC : no , no , no .\nC : the the shape of the remote control .\nA : the sh , but then you can you have to use with one hand .\nC : just like playstation thing .\nA : so , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , joystick is better .\nA : so , look at it .\nC : no , that's , got they're not in details .\nD : and on the , how much it costs ?\nD : it costs extra ?\nC : it's more expensive or less expensive , ?\nA : we you get it .\nA : so , after this meeting you have half an hour to fix it .\nC : then have to come with it .\nC : got my personal costs .\nC : don't the costs .\nC : then i'll make something up .\nA : so , do we have other concepts ?\nA : then for the components , we use normal battery .\nA : then it's ch cheapest way , .\nC : or the or the kinetic with normal battery .\nA : no , no kinetic .\nC : it's , , more expensive .\nA : kinetic is ch makes it more expensive .\nA : so we use normal battery .\nA : depends on the .\nC : depends on the scroll .\nC : if we use scroll , then we have the regular chip .\nC : if we don't use scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\nC : and that's the most expensive .\nA : and , we if you use the , we have to yes , .\nA : so , depends on the and the scroll .\nC : if we no scroll-wheel .\nC : so , have this .\nC : so , it will be the advanced chip , or the regu or the regular chip .\nA : so , the shapes of the design depends on the and but , it has to be small .\nC : or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ?\nC : and then just put also on on it ?\nA : if you have pistol , it l_c_d_'s not easy .\nA : but if you use phone .\nC : just use your thumb .\nC : use my thumb .\nA : but but then you have it .\nA : like , if you have pistol , you have it so .\nA : and the screen is , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .\nC : if you have joystick on no , if you have like an ni playstation game controller .\nC : and you move up , forward , down , left .\nC : then you have just , , little bit curved .\nC : it's not just straight .\nA : no , no .\nC : that's how we use it .\nC : that's why they make joysticks like that , .\nA : but then you look forward .\nA : and then you can , if you have to look at it .\nD : if you if we have then something standing here , with the .\nC : here's our designer .\nA : then it goes like this .\nA : if yes , .\nC : it's for the younger people .\nC : it's something new .\nB : it's or you can turn it inside .\nA : that's good good .\nA : but the , it may not break .\nC : now we put rubber around it .\nA : if that's possible .\nC : hard plastic , the shape , and around it hard around it rubber .\nC : and the the hand shape is also rubber .\nD : 't see the .\nD : but , the easy of , the ease of use wasn't the most important aspect of it .\nB : but that's no , that's true .\nD : for us it's about to sell it .\nC : this is something new .\nA : then this is the design .\nA : and the buttons are on the next page .\nA : so , depends on the cost .\nA : so , we have one minute .\nD : you have more .\nD : you have still ten .\nA : so hurry up .\nC : that's us together .\nA : you two stay here .\nA : now you have to .\nA : so it's clear .\nA : check your mail .\nA : so it has to be ready in the next meeting .\nA : so next meeting is called the detailed design .\nA : so everyth everything has to be ready .\nA : for your attention .\nD : see you at the next meeting ."], ["<t> The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick

<t> The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros. </t>  <t> The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons. </t>  <t> Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting. </t>  <t> Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will have an LCD screen. </t>  <t> The remote will have regular push-buttons instead of a joystick. </t>  <t> The remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour. </t>  <t> There was some confusion about the agenda. </t>  <t> The production costs of the initial design came to fifteen Euros, so the design had to be changed. </t>  <t> Which features should be removed or changed. </t>  <t> Which chip would be needed for the revised design. </t> ", "A : so , now , last time .\nA : can you push the button ?\nA : so i'm still the secretary .\nA : now , ask you to presentate the prototype .\nA : one of your you two .\nB : this , you mean ?\nB : yes , this is it .\nD : this is it .\nB : it's it's it's yellow .\nB : and , this is rubber .\nB : and and and this too .\nB : the the sides .\nB : and the rest is hard plastic .\nB : and we we had some we had new idea that that this can can be turned inside .\nB : and then it covers the these buttons until here .\nB : and then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\nB : so , you can still operate all the things .\nB : because you don't always use the menu .\nB : and then it can break .\nA : and the buttons ?\nB : and everything is blue , except the power button .\nB : and the mute .\nB : of , and the mute and the the other button .\nB : channel higher channel button .\nA : and the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\nB : yes , that's very obvious .\nC : up is channel up .\nC : down is channel down .\nC : to the is volume up .\nC : to the left is volume down .\nA : so if joystick and .\nA : what's the r_r_ .\nB : r_r_'s the the the the the company logo .\nA : so , we have so , what they say on the side is put fashion there .\nD : that's on the rub rubber part .\nB : that's about here .\nA : so , that's it .\nA : now , the finance .\nA : we if it's it if it's .\nA : so , i'm gonna look .\nD : do we do we change the do we change the the order ?\nD : or are we going to ev evaluate it first ?\nA : finance is it's no , first yes .\nA : we have to evaluate the product yet .\nD : that's that can be none .\nD : we gonna do the evaluation now , together .\nD : but have introduction how it works .\nD : so , it will come up .\nD : we , have thinked few evaluation criterias , based on our marketing strategy , on the latest trends , on user preferences .\nD : we have seven point scale from true , as .\nD : to false , seven ?\nD : and on base of each criteria , we need to give rating .\nD : we can , it look like this .\nD : but we gonna do it here , they said .\nD : so , you hope found out how to do it with word document .\nD : we have the word document you so we open up that blank here .\nD : think , what this just an example .\nD : so , this not very important .\nD : but , if get number in here .\nA : no , it's .\nD : we can't do that .\nC : i'll get it .\nD : so you have to think of it as the remote control is techno technologically innovative .\nD : and then we have to agree on the rating together .\nD : and in the end , we will count an average of all rating .\nD : the first on each item .\nA : what do you think ?\nD : it's , technologically using , it's not it doesn't contain many new features .\nD : so , it , will give it , , , four .\nC : the scroll-button is something also new .\nC : what not anoth , not lot of lot of remote controls have .\nC : technologically i'll give it an seven .\nC : si six six .\nD : so now you see it its statement .\nD : and you true or false .\nC : true or false .\nC : i'll i'll give it two .\nD : and true is one .\nA : so it's three .\nD : the first item .\nD : so , the second item .\nD : this product is for all sorts of customers .\nD : it's statement which disagree with , because we really aim at at young market and the way it looked in yellow , it's not really aimed for all customers .\nD : it doesn't look like that .\nA : so it's yes , it's for the younger group .\nB : but it's it's .\nA : so it's half half of the people .\nA : so it's four .\nB : it still has large buttons and not many buttons .\nB : so , the colours are for young people , but older .\nA : so , it's four .\nC : version three point o_ has other colours .\nA : give it four .\nA : we put the fashion in electronics .\nD : that's the motto of our company .\nD : do we do this with this product ?\nD : if we do this , as it's it's really orientates on the design .\nD : so would give it two .\nC : me too two , because only the battery is not techin technologically high standard .\nC : but the rest of it is .\nC : so , two .\nA : it's not fashion , it's new .\nA : it must be fashion .\nA : but it isn't .\nC : it it will be fashion .\nA : it if it's not fashion we can put it in it .\nA : so , it must be fashion .\nB : then make it three .\nD : yes , i'll think of that too .\nA : use my feet though .\nD : the next element is the product looks good .\nD : personally , do not prefer remote control that's fully in yellow .\nD : so , would give this five .\nC : give it one .\nB : yes , one .\nA : so , counting then is two and half .\nD : we have to do our two or three ?\nD : so , gonna do the next part .\nD : the next statement .\nD : it has not too much buttons .\nD : , have said is not because low number is better .\nD : and in the end we calculate an average .\nD : so , that's why it's negative in it .\nD : this one of our aims not have too much buttons .\nD : so , did we do that ?\nD : if we go to this fashion , we still have caused lot of buttons for the numbers .\nD : but you can you can go for that .\nD : and that way , you don't have lot of buttons over .\nD : so , would give this two .\nD : but where where is the ?\nA : next , six .\nA : it does not get lost easily .\nD : so , did we implement the sound ?\nC : just small thing .\nA : no , we did not .\nA : so , but can it get lost if it's such thing ?\nC : looks like pistol .\nA : not not normal shapes .\nC : it won't get between the pillows on the couch .\nA : it won't get lost .\nD : aimed for the younger market .\nD : did we achieve that .\nD : with the way it looks and it is designed , will give it two .\nA : me that was our target .\nA : there's fancy look-and-feel .\nD : that that was , , one of the most important things that trendwatch said .\nD : didn't say it in my presentation .\nD : but , does it have that ?\nD : would say yes .\nD : so , let's also give this two .\nC : gave this one because of the rubber .\nC : it feels soft .\nC : it looks like , bit like joystick .\nC : very fancy trendy .\nB : yes , one .\nA : it's bit personal .\nA : if it's fancy .\nA : so two is better .\nD : and , then the last one could think of , it goes with the latest trends .\nA : no , it's new .\nD : if we looked at the latest trends for the younger people , and they ate fruit and vegetables , has colour , compared to food but we didn't we did not paint any fruit and vegetable on it like that .\nD : so , would did not give this one or two .\nD : we'll go for three .\nC : go for two because the the shapes are still round .\nC : the latest trends are soft things , , like said in my presentation .\nC : but the the colours are basic , like yellow , red , blue .\nC : something what also younger people want .\nC : it's also trend , so i'll give it two .\nD : so , come back to the presentation now .\nD : so , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .\nD : so , we will do that .\nA : effort is three , ten and twelve .\nA : thirty , forty , fifty , .\nA : so , it's two and three nine two and one third .\nD : so , that's pretty low rating , .\nA : so , it's good .\nD : so , according to our own evaluation we did good job .\nD : how am doing ?\nD : and closed your slide-show .\nA : back to my .\nD : which one was the last for you ?\nA : so , now we have product .\nA : but , is it cheap enough ?\nA : so if i'll have look .\nA : we have battery .\nC : cheapest there is .\nA : it's the most advanced .\nA : we have that one .\nC : it's the most advanced .\nA : we have the simple , regular and advanced .\nA : we have the adva advanced .\nA : so uncurved or flat .\nA : single curved or double curved ?\nA : we have double curved .\nA : so then we have plastic , wood , rubber .\nA : we have half rubber , half plastic .\nA : yes , yellow .\nA : interface , push-button .\nA : scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or display .\nA : so , we have the we have two scroll-wheels ?\nA : and it's not really , it's this one .\nA : now , button supplement .\nA : we already , that's the from the for the buttons .\nA : the buttons are regular colour .\nA : so , then then then then then then then then , no .\nC : we're not gonna make it .\nA : it's too expensive .\nC : wh what what are the costs ?\nA : so , we have to change something .\nA : when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's .\nA : 'cause we can't lose the battery .\nA : we can't lose the advanced chip .\nA : we can't lose the double curve .\nA : we have rubber , special colour .\nD : we would have for remote control .\nC : don't t's very special colour .\nA : no , we no , it's ?\nC : is it special colour ?\nD : i've for remote control , it is .\nD : if we would have normal buttons instead of the joystick .\nD : for up down left .\nA : then we lose two euros .\nA : then we have thirteen euros .\nA : half euro too much .\nA : exactly the special colours .\nC : and what if we use only one just only plastic or only rubber ?\nA : so that's one euro .\nC : one euro discount .\nA : so , don't think that's good .\nA : we have to keep the .\nC : if we change the joyst the joystick thing into button up , button down , button , button left .\nA : then it's only thirteen euros .\nC : and then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?\nA : then you have or you have to cut this off .\nA : then it's not good anymore .\nA : i'll have look .\nA : we yellow rubber .\nC : and if you say it's just normal colour it's normal colour , wh no one will see it .\nC : normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , , left .\nA : one minute , .\nC : and it's twelve euros , .\nA : is it maximum .\nA : it's normal colour .\nA : but if you lose the joystick , it's still an advanced chip ?\nC : no , no , no .\nA : or it's then regular ?\nD : the advanced chip was for the wasn't it ?\nA : so , the advanced is for the and the regular for the joystick .\nA : and what if we lose the ?\nC : if we lose the , then we have an regular chip and no .\nA : but is it good design ?\nC : then you'll have to see the menu on the television .\nC : and you don't have the .\nD : if if we have the no buttons if we have we have not joystick but buttons , we would have , we have thirteen euros ?\nC : so , the t_v_s has to have to be up-to-date .\nD : and then we move the the colour .\nD : what will that be ?\nC : no knew that .\nA : so no joystick .\nA : no , but we then we get push-buttons from half euro .\nC : then it's twelve euro fifty , then it's .\nA : yes , yes , yes , yes .\nA : no special colour .\nA : twelve and half euros .\nA : so , we have to change that little bit .\nA : and you cannot use the red and green button .\nA : because if you give them colour , you have to pay point two euros .\nB : all the same , .\nC : so , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour .\nC : but then the print on it will change it .\nC : make it for everybody to see what button it is .\nC : how you call it ?\nA : so so now we have to change that , but that's .\nA : what's the normal colour ?\nA : so and where's ?\nA : so , now it's .\nC : and the joystick away .\nC : and its buttons .\nA : but then it will be just that ones .\nA : now it's very good .\nD : still , he waited at the no .\nA : now , project eva evaluation .\nA : what do you think of it ?\nA : about the project .\nC : about the process .\nC : the creativity was good enough .\nC : we have gun instead of remote control .\nC : you were the project project manager , and had the final vote .\nC : so that was clear .\nC : everybody has something to say about it .\nC : and no , only the the drawing was very difficult .\nC : but , nah .\nC : new ideas found .\nB : espe especially liked the the means , the the smartboard and , it it brings up new ideas when you work with with it .\nD : you have to compare it to if you would have normal normal project without laptops and without these devices .\nD : the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation .\nD : the draw-board , you can draw things .\nD : but it not really going very convenient .\nD : it will be easier if you have smaller monitor and you would also see there .\nD : and with normal mouse .\nD : and the project .\nD : agree on what was said mainly .\nD : but you always have that some people are talking more than others .\nD : and is then the task of the the project manager to also ask more to the people less talking .\nD : to tell their opinion .\nA : what do have to say .\nA : it was good .\nA : not too many discussions .\nA : so , it's good for the speed .\nA : so , we're ready ."], ["<t> The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, describing what the project would involve, the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting. </t>  <t> He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using, and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals. </t>  <t> The project manager then went over the project budget. </t>  <t> The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project, suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared. </t>  <t> The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas. </t>  <t> The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices. </t>  <t> They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons, using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons. </t>  <t> However, they were unsure about what the budget would allow. </t>  <t> The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power, but this might be difficult if using bluetooth. </t>  <t> The project manager closed the meeting. </t>  <t> Each member of the group will work on their individual tasks. </t>  <t> They will receive information from their personal coaches. </t>  <t> The group will design a trendy, original and user-friendly remote control. </t>  <t> The remote control will be sold for 25 euros with a profit aim of 50 million euros. </t>  <t> The remote will be sold internationally. </t>  <t> The production costs should be no more than 12.50 euros. </t>  <t> The remote will control multiple devices. </t>  <t> The remote will be sold directly to individual consumers rather than companies. </t>  <t> The group were unsure about whether they would be selling their product directly to consumers or to electronics manufacturers. </t>  <t> It was felt that the low production costs would not allow them to create a trendy high-end product. </t>  <t> Whether using glow in the dark buttons and bluetooth would mean that the remote consumes too much energy. </t> ", "B : good morning , flores .\nA : are you ready ?\nA : you should put the laptop into the square .\nB : for the cameras alright .\nA : for for the cameras , yes .\nA : good morning , sebastian .\nC : good morning , mister p_m_ .\nC : how are you today ?\nC : how was your business trip to boston ?\nA : actually didn't go , didn't feel like it .\nA : so do you want to open it as read-only .\nA : should close it here .\nB : you have the same message of windows cannot sen stand-by .\nB : close the the window .\nA : the waiting is for our marketing expert , ruud .\nC : is there schedule for this meeting ?\nA : yes , there is actually .\nA : will li list the agenda for today .\nA : for this meeting .\nA : good morning , ruud .\nA : it's important , .\nC : shall close the door .\nA : it's important that the laptops are exactly on the square , for the cameras .\nA : we're here to develop new product .\nA : i'm you've had mail from our account manager about it .\nA : and this is the first meeting to to generate some some ideas about it .\nA : you are here in specific role .\nA : ruud is here as the marketing expert , roo is here as the user interface designer and sebastian is here in the role of industrial designer .\nA : is that correct ?\nA : we're going to do little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here .\nA : then will tell you little bit about my idea of the project plan , and we will have discussion .\nA : this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .\nC : is there any room for little presentation ?\nC : during the discussion section ?\nA : this new product we are are are going to develop , it's remote control , television remote control .\nA : and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly .\nA : those are easy goals , and i'm we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .\nA : we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those things .\nA : the market , we should have look at the market .\nA : we are going to use pred project method during this development , which consists of three different design stages .\nA : the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , all of these stages mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then meet to discuss our the the the progressions , yes .\nA : the first stage , the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will make specific specification of that .\nA : the second is the technical functional design , what effect should the remote have ?\nA : this case control the the television .\nB : it's for the vision .\nA : and the last one is the working design .\nA : how exactly does it work in the technical sense .\nA : the other design stages , we will discuss that later .\nA : so we'll kop it keep it with the functional design .\nA : before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here .\nA : as you see now give presentation .\nA : it's also possible to use this one as .\nA : you can display pr two presentations if you want to .\nA : to presentate , to show us file you'll need to place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be .\nA : then we have this electronic white-board system .\nA : will show that now .\nA : you can draw on the board using this pen .\nA : there are little sensors , so do not grab it here , but lit more little bit more to the to the end .\nA : it it's on the eraser now , so we click the pen button .\nA : so not too fast writing .\nA : you can insert new slide or or white-board file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .\nA : it's quite the same .\nA : all our whi smartboard notes should be kept in the same file .\nA : so do not make new file .\nA : just use this one during the day .\nA : you can use the eraser to make something go away .\nB : but we all use the same white-board file so we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?\nA : in the meetings , only in the meetings .\nA : it's really like like regu regular whiteboard .\nA : you can choose the format , .\nA : let me see .\nA : it's because i'm not pen selected .\nA : current colour , you can choose another colour .\nA : and black , and you choose the line width .\nA : so now have different line width and colour .\nA : quite easy , if you do have any questions , just ask me .\nA : to , i'm wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us .\nA : as little training will ask ruud first to draw your own animal on new slide with different colour and different line width than the one now selected .\nA : roo , could you do the same ?\nB : but , flores .\nA : but different animal with different colour and different line width .\nA : sebastian is thinking about the animal .\nC : i'm just guessing what should be my favourite animal .\nB : i'm think about it too .\nB : it looked more than bunny than cat , but it works , ?\nA : it it should be cat .\nC : i'll give it try .\nA : i'm guessing horse .\nB : with very small legs .\nC : was very good in drawing .\nB : you should feed that that animal .\nC : you get the idea .\nA : so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .\nA : any questions , just just let me know .\nA : back to our project .\nA : the remote control we are going to develop will have selling price of about twenty five euros .\nA : the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros , which is quite number .\nA : we we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold , if there is market interest , in in more than one country .\nA : and the production costs should not be more than twelve euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by during the development , because , , those are important numbers .\nA : then the discussion , the time for sebastian to show his presentation .\nC : yes , have some technical issues which would like to present to you before we start the discussion , because there might be some influations influences .\nC : first about my role , role of the industrial designer .\nC : would like to think about the implementation of of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .\nC : so if someone of you comes up with ideas , i'll try to translate them in technical functions , but there might be some impossibilities .\nC : so that's one .\nC : also will propose some some implementations for that , but , these are quite the same .\nC : and also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .\nC : have some initial ideas about some things which are to take with you in the upcoming discussion .\nC : one thing about interopera operability .\nC : modern remote control should control device diverse subset of equipment .\nC : d_v_d_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .\nC : so one re one remote control for all your equipment .\nB : and for cell phone ?\nC : there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .\nC : it could come in handy .\nC : we should discuss that .\nC : and we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other .\nC : we're not living in the nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not is not really hot technical anymore .\nC : but you should think about the things like bluetooth .\nB : but , but the infrared , it's , , little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .\nC : but it's cost-effective .\nB : but all the t_v_s are equipped with infrared , so you you can most of them .\nC : not all , not all .\nC : so that's the point .\nC : so , but that's something we should discuss and about every everybody should think about it .\nB : or you shou sh use you should equip infrared and bluetooth together in one remote .\nC : so that's just my role , i'll just give you everybody some technical input , and now the time is to have little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion .\nA : so the the main por the main points you are telling us are focus on the inter operability , and , and and .\nC : yes , so one thing one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments .\nA : that was your presentation ?\nA : i'll go back to my own presentation .\nA : do t's time now to to discuss some things .\nA : sebastian told us few things about the technical implemen implications .\nA : there are other things like how to make it trendy , which is most ru ruud's role .\nA : the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is roo during this part .\nA : so let's start with you .\nA : how do you think the remote should function for the user ?\nB : had few things in mind .\nB : the interoperability , just like sebastian said , the remote should work on different t_v_s or even different , what is it , devices ?\nB : so it's universal remote control for customers to buy just new in store .\nC : yes , it should be something like that .\nB : it's not for for for philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , ?\nA : so we're we're going business to consumer , not we're we're it's not no .\nB : it's no have don't have the information for it .\nC : we're not developing this product for specific vendor , are we ?\nC : no , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to very broad public , so it should fit to every device .\nA : ruud , do you agree ?\nB : the techni fu technical function what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the t_v_ .\nB : that's just the basic technical function .\nB : so that was my really my part for this session .\nB : that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task as an as an device .\nA : so is that ease of use or is that more like .\nB : it just should change the t_v_'s state .\nB : so that's it .\nC : and you you see the buttons as as means of doing this ?\nC : or are there any other controls ?\nC : are there only any other cont , i've seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward , sidewords .\nB : or you want touch-screen or but .\nC : and it's very easy for user to to switch yes , to to switch between channels or change between tracks on on c_d_ , on on chapters , , on d_v_d_ player .\nB : they're very vu vulnerable .\nC : so that's an idea , .\nB : and for other user interface had , , it's more industrial thing .\nB : point at t_v_ , it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the t_v_ , so you must point everywhere , so infrared is , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should be restriction to that .\nA : not even pointed .\nA : gentlemen , just reminder , we we have five minutes left for this meeting .\nC : is that are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?\nC : so when you're not able to point at the device the range is very limited .\nB : if you if you go to radio or or .\nB : for t_v_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of t_v_ , so don't think think the range should be problem to that , but if you want to get it working with radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one speaker , then the range should be but .\nB : two more things .\nB : you should able to feel the buttons without it mis you have to you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand .\nB : you must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , .\nB : and you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al in dark too .\nB : so when it's dark those are two really user interface .\nA : i'll write down glow in the dark .\nA : want to hear ruud's input for this meeting .\nC : do do you yes , had , about three minutes ago , but i've seem to forget them forgot them .\nA : do you have anything already ab idea about how the market will respond to the such product ?\nA : or what we should take in account when developing such product ?\nD : most most things have already been said , like control multiple devices .\nD : and , , infrared might be an issue .\nD : he said about abo what he said about pointing .\nD : but lots of devices already use infrared .\nD : so we'll probably have to implement that .\nA : sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?\nC : yes , remember .\nC : you said something about visibility in the dark .\nC : would it be for user to have display on this remote control , on which you can see functions ?\nC : which makes it easier to operate it .\nB : but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with black mark on it .\nB : the the the digits in black .\nB : then it's already visible in dark .\nB : so it it don't have to be lightning or or fancy , it can be for design , .\nA : , , because because we wa we want to develop trendy product .\nC : yes , but there's cost limitation too .\nA : so , twelve euro fifty , .\nC : that's more so that's big problem , .\nC : the the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be high high-end product .\nC : the cost price is very low .\nB : just remind something .\nB : the digits of the the painting on the buttons should not fade .\nB : you have always have the soft buttons , always clear the the the paint on it .\nC : very good point .\nA : ha have one point which which comes in mind now .\nA : the device should either be rechargeable very easily or it should not consume too much power .\nA : because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every every other week .\nA : so we could only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment or .\nB : but necessary , .\nA : it's that's more sebastian's does it ?\nB : but then bluetooth might be problem .\nB : 'cause bluetooth , from the cell phone .\nC : it's use lot of ll , cell phones have integrated bluetooth also and , , it's it seems to work quite .\nC : so technically it will be possible .\nB : but you can't you can't use bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours day .\nC : no , you cannot .\nB : does it it's over ?\nA : gentlemen , i'm afraid we do not have any more time .\nA : so we will go back to our own work .\nA : next meeting starts in thirty minutes and , , your your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about it .\nA : so this was it .\nA : see you in thirty minutes ."], ["<t> There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. </t>  <t> The target group will be people below 40. </t>  <t> The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. </t>  <t> The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. </t>  <t> The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. </t>  <t> The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. </t>  <t> Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose. </t>  <t> It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition. </t>  <t> The design can focus on such customer needs, like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote. </t>  <t> The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will look into what would be an appropriate technology to help users find their remote, when it is lost. </t>  <t> The project manager will add the minutes into the project folder. </t>  <t> The ID will present the components concept. </t>  <t> The UI will present the user interface concept. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends. </t>  <t> LED's can be used to light up the remote. </t>  <t> Using them sparsely, as in mobile phones, could bring down the cost. </t>  <t> It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it. </t>  <t> The latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote. </t>  <t> A single, large, round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants. </t>  <t> Another button to switch between two channels could also be implemented. </t>  <t> The remote will also include volume and program selection, and speech recognition. </t>  <t> A recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption. </t>  <t> LED's would signify extra energy consumption. </t>  <t> Power-saving LED's are available, but these could be more expensive. </t>  <t> It's difficult to choose a technique to find a lost remote. </t>  <t> They cannot install a special button on a TV, and using a special signal, like clapping, is tricky, because it needs to be differentiated from normal sounds. </t>  <t> Similarly, using an extra base station would probably be too costly. </t>  <t> Adding such features may complicate the design and escalate costs. </t>  <t> There was a challenge regarding the need of the digit channels, based on the fact that they are not often used, and they also look dull. </t>  <t> Despite that, customers may want them to be on a remote; furthermore, they can be designed in a more attractive way. </t>  <t> The discussion also focused on their replacement with speech recognition, as the latter helps with locating the remote as well. </t>  <t> However, this solution may prove too expensive. </t>  <t> An expanded target group may have to be taken into account in order to achieve the projected sales and profits. </t> ", "A : let me see .\nB : there's one of mine .\nA : roo , welcome back .\nB : hello , flores .\nA : the waiting is for sebastian .\nA : there he is .\nB : we have slight problem .\nC : is there any time for cup of coffee ?\nB : opened the c_d_ rom box .\nC : can get cup of coffee ?\nA : you can't , .\nB : so just cancel it .\nC : during my work have no time either .\nC : so so too .\nA : this is life .\nB : opened the c_d_ rom box .\nB : but it's alright .\nA : people , welcome back with the second meeting .\nA : for now on the schedule are few points .\nA : first of all the opening , which we are doing now .\nA : second , received some new project requirements .\nA : i'm not if you received them as , but will tell you about it .\nA : then the three of you prepared presentation , ?\nA : then we'll do your one as la the last .\nA : the top goal of this we will figure that out .\nB : but you can't upload your presentation from here , believe .\nA : ca can you try to , we will see .\nD : if it if it if it's wireless could just put it in the .\nB : don't t's wireless here .\nA : it is , .\nB : or it is .\nA : the top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product , on the target group and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .\nA : we have forty minutes .\nA : so it's now .\nA : the new project requirements , first of all , we didn't speak about it , but we should not support teletext in the remote , because our board feels that teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .\nA : so we are not even going to try to implement it in our product .\nA : it's board decision .\nA : the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not feasible , it's not we we cannot make it because of the time to market that we have to deal with .\nA : the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than forty , which is important for you , ruud , and as for roo .\nA : because the product should be interesting and and should be bought by people younger than forty .\nA : then for roo , as important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .\nA : so the colour colours and the slogan do have to be in the product .\nA : is that clear ?\nA : any questions on these requirements ?\nA : the individual presentations , roo or sebastian , who of you would like to start ?\nB : how can geez , and sli and show .\nB : just press it .\nB : we we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous discussion .\nB : the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is to send messages to the television set .\nB : so that was the main important thing what remote control should do .\nB : then found two different remote controls , the multi-function remote control with many possibilities , but the lack of the feeling already mentioned in the previous discussion .\nB : and the ease-of-use remote control with the less possibilities but feeling in in touching the buttons .\nB : my personal preferences were ease of the easy to use remote control , because the user-friendliness and it can be more trendy in in user design .\nB : but your new goal was for people than less than forty years old .\nB : so the multi-function can be implemented in in our design .\nB : but it should it should be combination , but teletext buttons are not in our design .\nB : so it should take out , , eight buttons or so .\nB : but my in my opinion , the the easy to use r_c_ is the best possi possibility for us .\nA : ruud , did you get that ?\nA : so the important thing here is in the market , .\nB : and it's also ruud's insight in the in the topic .\nB : what what does the market want ?\nA : , we will we all .\nB : just for for user desi user friendliness should choose for the the ease of use remote control .\nC : it's still the thing .\nC : there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .\nC : all this device has to do is send messages to t_v_ set .\nC : and the most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to t_v_ set .\nC : tried to implement picture here , but it's hardly readable .\nC : can you see it ?\nA : no , it's not visible .\nC : there's energy source here .\nC : and there it's connected to three things .\nC : the user interface connected to chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using infrared light , which are sent to the receiver .\nC : that's the idea .\nC : and there's little picture , just for your imagination , how device like this should look or can look .\nC : what have found .\nC : usually these things consist of battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board .\nC : it's cased together , nothing more than that .\nC : it's almost every piece of equipment every piece of every t_v_ set is controlled infrared .\nC : there are some exceptions , but most of all have infrared controls .\nC : and the more luxury remote controls have lithium buttons .\nC : and that's what we yes .\nB : the glow in the dark concept we discussed .\nC : in the and it's little more little bit more fancy also .\nC : so we should consider that .\nC : have basic scheme of the things which are implemented .\nC : this is all there is .\nC : there's just one chip .\nC : there are few buttons connected .\nC : the buttons are lit .\nC : and the whole thing is transmitted by infrared li diode , and there is not power source here .\nC : so that's the total design of this piece of equipment .\nC : there's nothing more to it .\nA : so it's fairly easy .\nC : it's fairly easy .\nC : it's been done many times before , and we should we should succeed in in our plan to do this .\nB : succeed in it also .\nC : so , so personally we should infra use infrared , because otherwise our device cannot communicate with almost every t_v_ set .\nC : so that should be clear .\nC : another important point is we really should use energy sparse , friendly components .\nC : there are specially designed energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components .\nC : and if we want to use rechargeable design or energy-save design , we should really implement them .\nC : for cost-effectiveness , we should really use very low-cost circuit board , because most of the production cost are are in this part of the equipment .\nC : and the money we save on using this we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques , blinking leds and all that fancy .\nC : our users will really will really like that .\nB : and what's the if we use the leds , does it use much more energy or .\nC : no , they're power friendly leds also .\nC : so we can use them .\nC : so that's no problem .\nB : for the same costs , it's can be in our combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's .\nC : no , they're they're little bit more expensive , but by making we can we can make its .\nD : you could only lit the buttons the buttons that are used most .\nD : so , the channel switching .\nD : or , true .\nA : but but the question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such difference in the costs if you already plan to include fancy lightning techniques , .\nB : but , it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , and not for , but not for each button one led , .\nC : it's not one light , it there are more lights in in in mobile device .\nC : no no no , no .\nC : so , this should be it .\nC : have think about it .\nD : mine is already outdated .\nA : we ar we are very curio curious to what the market will feel about such product .\nD : since , make then i'm the target market is ten million units .\nA : so any income is welcome .\nD : of of which we should sell about forty percent to make the five million .\nB : could you step little bit more to the ?\nD : but since the other part is forty percent of the market , thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market .\nD : but since the requirements changed , that's not good idea .\nD : it's this till true , .\nD : that they only use ten percent the buttons .\nD : the buttons to zap are used the about fifteen hundred times , when the power button is only used one time .\nD : and the volume button's only four times .\nD : so they're obv the most important buttons .\nD : and lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .\nD : so we might want to build in feature to support them .\nD : some audio signal .\nD : like home phones .\nC : or find finding function , .\nA : that's definitely interesting .\nC : that's quite yes .\nA : it it separates our product from others as .\nD : and , this obvious , and he also said it .\nA : so that's what the market tells us .\nD : that's about it , yes .\nB : the volume and the zap buttons are the mostly used .\nD : mo zap buttons most .\nB : so , should just have design the perfect design for those only those buttons .\nD : volume , they are use lot .\nD : but more than all the other buttons .\nD : so , that's problem .\nC : yes , we should focus on that , .\nC : the technical there there are no technical difficulties .\nC : there's no elaborate technique used in this equipment .\nC : so don't think we have any hiccups there .\nC : so we can fully concentrate on developing product that is really what the market needs .\nC : so it's good idea to think about these buttons and and and sound signal .\nB : the sound signal .\nB : just one thing i'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute the sound ?\nC : that's bit of that's problem .\nB : another device is not solution .\nA : like clapping in your hands , like turning on and off the the the lights .\nB : it should be , but you'll get some new technologies for it .\nC : there there are some devices who incorporate this technique already .\nC : there are video sets and they have special button , the find the remote control button .\nC : you press it and your t_v_ set starts to make weird sound , and your remote controls then start to beep .\nA : reports rep respend response to it .\nB : just like the phones the but but t_v_s don't have all buttons .\nC : yes , that's it .\nC : yes , same thing .\nA : but , because we do not have home .\nC : no , so we we should use something else .\nD : and you , and usually and even if the t_v_ set would have such button , you would have to walk to your t_v_ , and it's and so if if you'd be watching movie , it would constantly beep .\nB : but believe you will have an i'm convinced sebastian will find one solution for us .\nC : we do not control the t_v_ set so .\nC : yes , yes .\nC : and we we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about it's quite complicated .\nA : so what about the clapping technique ?\nA : because you se , you see it lot in in light lightning , peak .\nC : it's quite complicated .\nC : because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .\nC : yes , yes .\nC : the characteristics the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is generated few times within certain period of time .\nC : but there are many other sounds which are exactly the same from the point of view from remote control .\nC : yes , so we don't want that .\nB : but we can have just home stat base station next to the t_v_ .\nC : we can something like that .\nB : just little antenna or something .\nB : you lost don't think people would bother walking to the t_v_ and press that button because they lost the their remote .\nC : is there not something something more easily , don't think .\nB : that's just just base station next to the t_v_ is the best possibility .\nC : no , and the the most important thing for people is that there's central point to which they can go and perform some .\nC : and then the remote control reports itself , so we should use have we should use something like that .\nC : you do not want another device , which can be everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .\nC : yes , something like that .\nC : but that will be very costly , .\nC : so that's not good idea .\nA : we we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such function , if it's possible within the costs and all that things .\nA : sebastian should have detailed look later on and come up with solution , because that's his his field of expertise .\nC : but before do that want to warn you that by implementing this function the technical design will become more complicated and it will become more costly also .\nC : because there will be additional components which which will be used .\nC : and there are some implepe imp , so , because when you have newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .\nB : and do we even prefer the sound above the the leds , the lightning function ?\nB : it's unique item it will be an unique feature of our remote control .\nA : it's distinction in the market .\nA : it's different exactly .\nA : it's an uni an unique feature , and it's worth looking and and probably more interesting than than the lights .\nB : and just about the user interface , came up with an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .\nB : what should we choose in in design ?\nA : according to ruud , people do not use all the extra features very very often .\nB : the extra functions .\nD : have the numbers have the numbers here .\nD : we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function .\nA : we we do have wise board , so i'm not questioning that .\nD : channel selection is the most important .\nA : so on the relevance scale the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .\nA : we skip that .\nB : so it just the basic functions .\nB : and we don't have to use it for d_v_d_ players and all .\nC : no , no .\nC : so that's out of the question .\nB : just through the easy design .\nA : we should go for the easier one .\nB : we can make design when when there's not mu much buttons in it .\nB : so just few buttons , trendy design , lightning effects wh and the sound .\nC : we should save costs by not implementing lot of functions and the money that we can save from that we should use for having design and thinking about the user interface and , .\nA : ruud , how do you feel about that ?\nA : do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to simple .\nD : we include other innovative functions then they might , 'cause young people like new features .\nD : so and if you use that stick for volume control and channel selection , you have the two most important functions in one button .\nA : so this is is .\nC : is it there's another possibility .\nC : you can make it look like an easy piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , because it has many functions .\nC : it's more important to make the make it look like very friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but nevertheless .\nA : but but are we not in in the in the manual if you have few buttons , no display , it's it's working with with shift functions and one button can but but how does how does the remote report give back to the user in what state it is ?\nC : was more thinking about more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks like that .\nC : if if it's user-friendly .\nC : that's your field of expertise .\nA : because we do not implement user history .\nC : there's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that the system .\nA : know , but but if we use like stick , , .\nC : we can use light for that .\nC : when you move the stick to to position , light next to it can lit up .\nC : so i've just pushed the button , or changed the channel or turned up the volume .\nC : something like that .\nA : and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced functions .\nB : but does it then should just use instead of the stick , like many cell phones , just round , should we just use it's already , we have blank .\nA : draw draw it on the board .\nC : something like that .\nC : it's not really stick , but yes .\nB : it's just an easy way of of round button what which can be pushed in four directions .\nB : instead of stick .\nB : stick is vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down or just round button should be the trick , .\nA : it can break down .\nC : yes , yes .\nC : and yes , and this also looks more fancy , .\nC : it it will attract more public , .\nC : but you're the marketing man .\nD : and it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it attract younger people because new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .\nB : volume and something like that .\nB : the programme up and down .\nB : and the vol , the pen doesn't really does what want .\nA : but we still we're still in the question of putting in advanced options .\nA : ruud just told us the market is interested in some advanced new techniques .\nA : however , keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those things .\nA : we need to find balance between the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .\nB : but our our next step to look at is just that .\nB : so don't t's we have something to do .\nB : we can't discuss it now , because no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , .\nA : for we do have to decide this this meeting .\nA : we need to have the the user function the functions decided and our target audience .\nB : but teletext is so is just scrapped .\nC : do do you want list of functions ?\nC : do you want an explicit list ?\nC : which incorporates all function available on the device ?\nA : do not want full it's not necessary to to have full list , but want the functions , the most important are volume and programme selecting .\nB : the ten digits .\nA : , that that's what we should think about .\nA : how is the remote going to look ?\nB : and just one function .\nA : not not in the user interface , but .\nB : the the the the programme to programme button , the switch to two channels , when you have something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can change .\nA : bit of split mode .\nC : yes , yes .\nA : dual channel watch .\nA : should write that down .\nC : you're the secretary .\nA : ruud , what's your last name ?\nA : mielsen , because was writing it down in the last mielsen .\nA : put all the minutes make into the shared folder .\nA : so if you want to have look at it , where to find it .\nC : but make make sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .\nA : that's that's if you want to do it , sebastian .\nB : our b_s_c_ w_ the ten digits ?\nA : , so so volume .\nA : and and do we want the ten digits ?\nC : yes , that's important .\nC : are are you ?\nD : if you want to go to channel ninety and you have that button .\nC : i'm not so .\nC : that's complicated , but is that so relevant ?\nC : because don't think but you should shou you should know that .\nB : wouldn't buy it personally .\nC : if it were so .\nB : remote control without the ten digits .\nC : imagine when imagine when you're when you have satellite decoder and and you have , , about six hundred channels , imagine you want this .\nB : and the most just elder elder people would would buy it , but .\nD : but , and if if we and if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .\nC : but if you're regular t_v_ user , and you just want to watch the the dutch television networks , , you can you can use about ten buttons .\nA : but we do have thirteen different dutch channels .\nB : the older people only use five of them .\nC : but how how often do you watch all these channels ?\nD : so and and there are some numbers about speech recognition here that younger people would like it .\nC : no , you're probably .\nC : but these ten buttons look bit dull .\nC : don't you think ?\nA : it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the you you can make them very fancy by nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .\nB : on the design .\nC : then there should be should done be done something specific with it .\nA : so i'm i'm do not agree exactly , exactly .\nC : so you can experiment by with with shape or with size or with colour , that thing .\nD : it might be expensive and hard to implement , but it would be solution for .\nC : it can be combined with the find the remote control .\nC : so when you add speech recognition to your remote control , it's very easy to change the channel .\nC : that's one thing .\nC : and it's very easy to find your remote control .\nC : so that's possibility , but i'm afraid it will be bit costly .\nC : but when we .\nA : if if we would drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume , because people do not always want to use their voice , .\nD : especially elder people don't like voice recognition .\nD : so then we should implement such but yes .\nA : but we do focus on younger people .\nA : we it it's board decision .\nC : it should should work , it sh we should manage that .\nB : so we have to to make decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .\nC : the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage .\nC : it's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find find the remote control button remote control function .\nC : so that's that's big advantage , .\nC : there's only one disadvantage by implementing this .\nC : the power saving power saving will be bit more difficult .\nC : so we can expect that there will be less longer life to the batteries .\nC : but can we we can mething smart about it .\nC : there are some hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate solar panel and rechargeable batteries .\nC : so when you just leave the device in in light room , it charges itself .\nA : but but but can we manage it bu for the costs ?\nC : you have to do nothing for it .\nD : and if we if we could inc include cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be big problem .\nA : because it seems like very is cradle very cheap ?\nB : twelve dollar fifty .\nC : i'll have to find that out .\nC : so no , that's very cheap .\nC : it's , it's very cheap .\nC : that's no problem .\nC : it's just case with two metal contacts .\nA : know , but there should be an adapter as .\nC : it's yes , but they're they're mass production .\nC : they're very cheap .\nC : so it will cost us practically nothing .\nA : we we have about ten minutes left this meeting .\nA : would like to hear you all have things not spoken about , , but that are important .\nA : ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition data .\nA : are there other things about the market we should know ?\nD : we dealt with the most important information .\nD : just that the younger part of the market isn't the forty percent we want to sell to .\nD : so we we should for least bit look at the older people .\nD : but with buttons like that , which are easy to use , we might attract them too .\nD : so don't think that's big problem yes .\nA : so although we are focussing on younger people to make it profitable profitable .\nA : we we , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .\nB : have nothing nothing to add , .\nA : nothing to add .\nC : want to make summary of all all things spoken and the different possibilities .\nC : so we've decided to implement seemingly easy design .\nC : so on the outside it looks easy , but we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .\nC : so that's one the those are the choices we have to make .\nC : but there's big advantage in making it more elaborate by implementing speech techniques , voice recognition , that these kinds of things .\nC : it makes it also more attractable , , to our audience .\nC : there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques , which our customers will like .\nC : the disadvantage is that there are some concerns about the the costs and the things like battery lifetime , energy saving .\nC : another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons .\nC : if we just add chip which does the voice recognition , our circuit board will become even more cheap .\nC : so that's another , it wa it it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .\nA : and that was the main issue , ?\nA : the the board .\nC : and this even makes it more cheapy .\nB : but the cheaper the ch the the chip or what was it ?\nB : the circuit board .\nC : the circuit board .\nB : the fewer buttons you can use on it .\nC : the fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .\nA : no , it's .\nA : it's the other way around , .\nC : and it's very cheap to incorporate an integrated circuit , chip .\nC : so that's that's another advantage .\nA : it shouldn't be big issue .\nB : then we should just take look at the costs and especially for the voice recognition .\nC : so yes , because yes .\nC : so it can be costly .\nA : i'm not how how we'll determine the costs , will have look at it .\nA : you will get some information on that .\nA : i'm not how how that .\nC : yes , al hope my personal coach will have lo look at it .\nA : we're qui quite done .\nB : we're done , .\nA : for now we will have the lunch break .\nA : i'm how long the break will be , but we'll find out .\nA : then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , and i'm your personal coaches will assist you with it .\nA : will put the minutes made in the project documents folder .\nA : if you want to look at it , just do .\nA : the interface designer , would like to the next meeting would like to receive the components concept .\nA : roo , from you would like to see i'm , , i'm .\nA : user interface designer , roo , would like to see the user interface concept .\nA : and , it should be easy , that's what we concluded .\nB : the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis decisions sebastian makes .\nB : about the voice recognition .\nA : it should be an easy interface with not so much buttons .\nA : just volume and programme one .\nA : and , some some fancy lights .\nA : that's what we decided .\nC : so we drop the voice recognition ?\nA : no no no , we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated , it's it's user interface , but was talking about really the design of the no .\nC : do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ?\nA : we can decide the next meeting .\nC : because i'll have some updated info on that adapt .\nA : all of you have updated info .\nA : i'm the marketing expert will receive you will do some trend watching .\nA : and i'm the market will will change , adapt and so we will see that .\nA : that's it for now .\nA : any other questions or can we have the lunch ?\nC : we can have the lunch .\nB : i'll take the lunch ."], ["<t> For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. </t>  <t> The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and

batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources. </t>  <t> Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute. </t>  <t> Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote. </t>  <t> The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells. </t>  <t> The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours. </t>  <t> The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype. </t>  <t> They will think about ways to make their product different from the others in the market. </t>  <t> They will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface. </t>  <t> The ID and UI will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish, or for the whole front of the remote. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation. </t>  <t> Changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends, but also trends followed by other age groups. </t>  <t> A scroll wheel will be included in the design. </t>  <t> A regular chip will be needed for this. </t>  <t> A single-curved rubber casing can also be used. </t>  <t> LCD is not going to be implemented. </t>  <t> The preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells. </t>  <t> It is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used, because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough, as one would do with similarly powered watches. </t>  <t> The use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated, as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project. </t>  <t> Using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient, since the remote will have to pointing towards the TV at the same time for the infrared to work. </t>  <t> LCD screens may add an extra hi-tech touch, but given all the other features, it might be too much. </t>  <t> The company colours (grey and yellow and black) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone. </t>  <t> Printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable, but cannot be done by the manufacturing department. </t>  <t> The front could have a rubber finish, or the buttons will be made of rubber. </t>  <t> It was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture, not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote. </t> ", "A : do you need to change anything on it ?\nA : because otherwise will already open it .\nD : unless things have suddenly change again .\nA : is it much changes ?\nD : you've got new information , like last time .\nA : didn't no no .\nA : do hot have only the same information .\nA : hello , sebastian .\nC : hello hello mister p_m_ .\nA : believe miss tentel is with us as , in the control room .\nC : that's where the thinking goes on .\nA : it's that roo again , always late .\nC : you should punish him .\nC : you're the p_m_ .\nA : see some interesting .\nA : people , welcome back .\nA : the third meeting .\nA : have some points would like to some some issues would like to point out .\nA : first of all , if you make minutes yourself as , like sebastian does , could you put them on the shared folder ?\nA : if you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you wrote down , so could can use that in the in the report .\nA : the second thing , was thinking to myself , have this little remote control , and i'm talking to it , but still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared .\nA : that's quite strange .\nA : we'll come to that later , .\nA : the agenda for now are there any pre-discussion questions ?\nA : we wi we will have your individual presentations , then the decision on the remote control concept , and the closing .\nA : forty minutes in total for this .\nA : so we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , the progress you've made .\nA : it might be smart to look at ruud's information first , because understood there are some significant changes in the market situation .\nC : just press the button , it works .\nD : ease of use is important , but innovation is more important , and fancy look and feel is even more important .\nD : and some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material .\nD : probably watch too much sponge bob .\nD : the older group still prefers dark colours .\nD : simple shapes material .\nD : but we since we are concentrating on the younger group .\nA : sec se could you go to the previous slide ?\nA : because i'm taking minutes and it were the important themes enclose .\nA : the feel of to be spongy , so so , , it might not be it it shouldn't be too hard .\nC : so do you think when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?\nD : one example given was this , so assume they just want something colourful .\nD : not specifically an apple as remote control .\nC : not something dull .\nB : but they like dark colours , you said in the .\nD : no , the younger group likes more colourful objects .\nB : then suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .\nD : but which one ?\nB : had or we could make .\nC : but can you can you go back to that slide ?\nC : the just one slide back , no no no .\nC : and the feel of the material has to be spongy .\nC : has it something to do with that natural feeling also , do you think ?\nD : but personally wouldn't like sponge as remote control .\nD : but soft material .\nD : but not real sponge .\nA : it it it rubber or or .\nD : and like the older group likes familiar materials , but that doesn't mean we should use wood , so , this this is an example of what they would like .\nD : but since we're conten concentrating on the younger group , we should use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .\nD : so we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .\nC : it's quite interesting .\nA : you could make few very colourful ones , and very traditional co cover .\nB : i'm thinking about the bananarama telephone telephone from siemens .\nB : the yellow rubber telephone .\nB : it's the it's the rubber cover .\nA : it is , it is .\nB : and it's colourful .\nB : it looks likes banana .\nB : we have the fruit , we have the colours .\nA : do the phone ?\nB : we have the simple design .\nC : the phone , but imagine it .\nA : it's the siemens c_ twenty five , believe it's it's the one the post-bank gave away , the very you kn , ruud , as ?\nC : that one , yes .\nB : and the the light blue and it's also in yellow .\nC : now kn , know , know .\nC : yes , i've seen it .\nC : i've seen it .\nD : i've seen it , but .\nA : do you have thit that was .\nD : that's about it .\nA : so the the important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group .\nA : and colouring is important and and soft materials .\nC : so so ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important .\nC : and what was even more important ?\nD : the fancy look and feel .\nC : so that's the most important thing for our customers .\nA : roo , could you do your presentation ?\nB : don't ha really have much to add , because most of things we already said in the previous discussion .\nB : the previous ideas were voice recognition and the round button for the channel programming and volume .\nA : t's good to to sum up the things we already thought about .\nB : few interface found on the internet are are these .\nB : these are both with with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just , , weird shape .\nB : so suggest couldn't had small mock-up sign on the on paper .\nB : but it didn't work .\nB : my pen didn't load the information .\nB : so made really simple shape on in powerpoint .\nB : but we could make round an oval remote control .\nC : but it's it's it's organic , so that's very good .\nA : and what i'm thinking about , we should make very light but grip this is how you hold remote control .\nA : it shouldn't be too glatt , too slippery , because .\nB : but if you have something like the siemens phone , it's rubber .\nC : you have to grab it .\nB : so it's easy in your hand .\nC : there are there are also remote controls who have little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get really good grip on it .\nA : ex for your fingers , .\nC : so you you don't have to attain much pressure to it .\nC : it's it's lot easier .\nA : it grips automatically .\nC : but i'll i'll go into that deeper in my presentation .\nB : and to add on ruud's information , in this interface we can have high-tech with the voice recognition and , , the the fancy colours and and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .\nB : and all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and and so on .\nA : way too much for our goal , .\nB : so if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty thirty controls on it .\nC : but i'll i'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities .\nC : had talk with our manufacturing division , and we had talk about all the different components who are in this design .\nC : these are the things we've looked at .\nC : and used the web to find my information .\nC : about the casing , we have three different casing possibilities .\nC : we have the uncurved or flat case .\nC : that's the most common remote con control form we're used to is just it ju it's just box .\nC : i'm don't have any pictures of of this thing .\nC : we have curved one .\nC : it's curved in two dimensions .\nC : you have to imagine it's bit like wave form .\nC : so it's little more advanced in its in its shape .\nC : and we have an even more advanced shape , which is curved in three dimension .\nC : you can compare it little bit with the big grey image you had in your presentation .\nC : the the big remote control , something like that .\nC : but it's quite advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use .\nC : for these casings we have different types of finishing .\nC : we can use plastic , which is very slippery and not so , but you can give it any colour , which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery .\nC : we can use wood and titanium .\nC : we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .\nC : and these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source .\nC : which brings me to the different energy sources .\nC : we even seem to have hand dyn dynamos for powering our remote controls .\nC : you really have to imagine like winding up your it would be very new , but it's retro style , .\nA : it would be very new to the market , but .\nC : this is quite interesting .\nC : there's there's also kinetic energy supply .\nC : so when you're watching t_v_ or when you're you you have to make some energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .\nB : like the watch .\nC : it have it it has to move , that's the the sense of it .\nC : and you can store the energy in the in the thing .\nA : if if hook on to that , the kinetic thing is very funny .\nC : it's very funny .\nA : solar is it's , but it's , , your your calculator has solar panel .\nA : hand dynamo , , know .\nB : but if you're watching movie , how many times you take the the remote control and and if if you have watch , you have the kinetic idea in watch also .\nB : you you walk and but you you're sitting on couch .\nC : but from your own watch your watch uses minimal con it consumes minimal amount of energy .\nC : the the shaking of your body , which is almost every activity makes your body shake , it charges it .\nC : but the problem here is that it it supplies very little amount of kinetic energy .\nC : so you have problem when you're watching movie and you haven't moved the remote remote control in in an amount of time , and you want to switch the channel , , it might not work .\nC : so that's something you have to keep in mind .\nC : so , but there's possibility com to combine it with traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .\nA : because the voice recognition feature consumes quite lot of power .\nC : yes , it does .\nC : i'll come to that later .\nC : and we have the traditional solar power , which is just piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .\nC : the user interface controls , we have the push-buttons and we also have scroll-wheels .\nC : and these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .\nC : so it's just like mouse .\nC : you can scroll , you can also push it .\nC : in the indicators we have the displays , which means you can watch in display which channel you have chosen like that of the li amount of volume which is currently and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things .\nC : so we don't really have the the button we had in mind in our in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four yes .\nB : we can just make four push-buttons in form of round .\nC : that is possible too .\nB : but don't think the scroll-wheels had some had some information about it too .\nB : don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .\nA : this will be the remote , ?\nB : 't see any scenario where you would use scroll-wheel with button on it .\nC : mayb , me neither .\nC : when you integrate some functions .\nA : with channel selector .\nA : what about integrating scroll-bar on this side ?\nB : that's possibility , but but flores , think about scenario where where you would use the scroll-button for volume , .\nC : it's do it's done before .\nA : because this is how you keep it volume ?\nC : it's quite quite good , yes .\nC : it's it , what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel .\nC : there's no scenario where you use the button in the scroll-wheel .\nC : you just use the wheel .\nA : what about mute ?\nA : thi this is my volume button .\nA : and either on this side or this side and click it to muten the device .\nC : that that that's one possibility , .\nA : and and it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market .\nC : it's quite goods .\nA : so i'm looking for way to make it little different than the traditional ones .\nA : so that that's something you two need to think about .\nA : ruud , wha what do you thing about scroll-bar ?\nD : it's obvious new .\nD : so it might attract the young customers .\nC : but it's done before , there are many other devices like telephones and our radio , pocket radios .\nC : we use this .\nC : and , it's it's been done years ago and don't see it anywhere now .\nC : so it's not no .\nA : all the sony telephones use it , , for volume .\nA : nokia has , , it's not really scroll-wheel , but on their side the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .\nC : yes , but it uses two separate buttons .\nA : know , it's not really scroll-wheel .\nC : it doesn't use .\nC : something for roo here .\nA : for you too , .\nB : believe if you have what we've earlier said , the grip places in in the remote control .\nB : you have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in range of your thumb .\nC : wi within reach .\nC : yes , you have to .\nB : so in that case the volume button on the side of the remote control would be perfect .\nC : we have to know , if you want to use these rubber double-curved case , you must use these push push-buttons .\nC : there's no way you can integrate displays .\nC : there's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .\nC : there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things .\nC : so that's limitation .\nC : about the components , just the hardware .\nC : we have three types of chips we can use and these chips incorporate all the logica and hardware that is needed to send to send signal .\nC : we have simple , regular and advanced chip .\nC : and there is something like sample sensor and sample speaker , which is little cryptic to me .\nC : but that's the the voice recognition thing that we are thinking about .\nB : you can have some information about it .\nB : in the voice recognition you say word you can programme words like volume up .\nB : of mute , let's say mute .\nB : you programme it , you mute and you you give an an action to it that that's really the mute function and when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats your saying .\nB : so that's the sample sensor .\nB : so if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's , believe it's , and then he he repeats its action what which he believes it is .\nA : it performs the action .\nB : so you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .\nC : so that's the the voice recognition item we were searching for .\nC : this sample sensor requires an regular chip , .\nC : no op i'm not very .\nC : no , it's not in here .\nC : if we want to use the display , we really need the advanced version , which is bit little bit more costly .\nC : if we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version .\nC : and if we don't want to use any of these more advanced functions we can keep with the simple chip , which is bit cheaper .\nA : did we already decide on the display ?\nC : no , but that's something for roo here to think about .\nB : don't have haven't looked for for information about it , but don't nformation don't think you need it on display .\nB : especially when when we have to look at cost , don't think 'cause all any t_v_ can can view digit on on screen , .\nC : don't think either .\nC : don't think you need it .\nA : on screen display .\nC : my conclusion , unfortunately the market has decided the little other than .\nC : the market would like sort titanium casing , but they seem to like natural .\nC : so we should think about wood finish .\nC : i've chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy .\nC : it's more reliable , it's cheaper .\nC : so don't think we should use the dynamo thing .\nC : the kinetic thing it it's it's possibility .\nC : it's it's more advanced , but i'm you should combine it with batteries .\nA : it's bit too too flashy , too .\nC : otherwise it will not too advanced , .\nC : it's in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .\nA : but that that's the same with the solar cell .\nA : that's no different .\nC : and it's more robust .\nC : it's more it's more functional .\nB : but what about the markets wants colourfuls designs ?\nB : so if you use titanium .\nA : no no , but the that's what sebastian said .\nC : the titanium thing we have to skip it .\nA : he said this is what this is my personal preference .\nA : but but yet , understood that the market is different .\nA : so no , rubber with colours .\nC : so we should skip the titanium , and we should use wood like that .\nD : and , the , the older people liked wood .\nB : and would think and they can be implemented with regular chip ?\nC : so it it needs to be rubber .\nD : no the , the younger people liked soft material .\nC : these scroll-wheels , they they can be they can be handy .\nC : so yes , they can .\nC : but they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple , i'm not very .\nB : but we also we already need the regular chip for the sample sensor speaker , evalu but most infrared remote controls don't have to be pointed .\nC : that's an different so , if you if you stick with the the simple straight-forward not curve design , it's too dull .\nA : but but do we want the curved design , or it's too dull .\nC : don't think our customers will like it .\nC : and if you take the double-curved , then you cannot you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .\nC : so this is the best of two worlds .\nA : what about the issue addressed at the beginning of the meeting ?\nA : the voice function with the infrared issue .\nA : because it it's of cour .\nC : it's it's imagine it's very dull to talk to device if you have to point to another device .\nC : it's very unlogical .\nC : the there has to be some pointing at .\nA : depends also on your on your , it depends on your walls actually .\nC : but all lights get absorbed , .\nB : if you if you take your hand before it , , it won't work , but you can point it just to the other wall .\nA : if you have have smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably .\nA : but if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then , it might be bit more of issue .\nC : yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .\nC : so it has an it's easier .\nC : suggest we use the the sensor sample .\nC : the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nC : with with regular chip .\nB : and the regular chip .\nC : it gives us the advantage of yes , yes .\nB : and and the scroll scroll-wheels .\nA : like the scroll wheels idea .\nC : and skip and skip the part .\nC : don't it's any value added thing .\nA : it looks , according to ruud , the the the market likes new flashy technology , and is , know , but it's it's less standard than than , we are not very we do not know much about the the the financial part .\nC : it's not very flashy and new .\nA : that's the problem .\nA : because if we do have enough space in in our finance , would say do integrate it , because it it adds little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .\nB : but we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp the speaker the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .\nC : our customers will go insane .\nC : it's it's too much .\nA : ruud , do you have any anything you would like to add or or thoughts or no ?\nD : nah , no , don't .\nA : sebast nee , roo ?\nA : roo , do you have any other nothing more .\nA : sebas , we we need to describe decisions now .\nC : the the next phase will be the not the what is the next phase flores ?\nA : so on the energy , , we decided .\nA : the case rubber with one one one curve .\nA : user interface then the corporate identity should be in the product .\nB : but can't scroll-wheels work with one one-curved case ?\nC : yes , they can work .\nC : they cannot work with double-curved .\nC : that's that's problem .\nC : i'll check it for you .\nA : that is something for roo and sebastian .\nA : you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .\nA : keep it in mind .\nA : and the buttons , talked about it now .\nA : the next phase , sebastian , is the design of the look and feel .\nA : the user interface design .\nA : and for you , the product evaluation .\nA : i'm your personal coach will give you more information on that .\nA : and the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard .\nA : and i'm going to plan my holidays .\nC : so you will be on the bahamas .\nB : the project drawing is for the next , .\nA : it's it's when we come back in thirty minutes , you will have prototype ready .\nC : so can you give us summary of all decisions we've made ?\nA : one of you could write it down .\nA : you you need to help me .\nA : the casing is curved , single-curved .\nC : start with the casing .\nC : what about the energy source ?\nA : traditional batteries and solar .\nB : but can there be wor can they work together ?\nB : or do we have to choose between them ?\nB : 'cause if we have to choose ?\nA : no , they can be complementary .\nA : al al every device .\nC : it it should be .\nB : what if not ?\nC : there should be really no problem .\nC : they can be supplementary .\nC : that's no problem .\nC : so so just the energy source is the batteries and the solar .\nA : battery and solar , .\nC : what about the finishing of the case ?\nC : we have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?\nA : with colourful rubber .\nA : if it's possible with different covers , but i'm not if our suppliers can can help us with with such wish .\nC : and we should use the company colours .\nC : something like black and red .\nC : black and yellow .\nA : grey and yellow or black and yellow .\nB : grey and yellow .\nC : grey yellow , .\nB : yellow case and grey buttons , .\nA : although don't think that's very colourful .\nA : except for the yellow , but could think of more attractive set of colours .\nC : it's it's not very dull .\nC : it's quite modern actually .\nC : don't you think ?\nA : was more thinking about the fruit colours that the ruud showed us before .\nB : believe the but you have already you must have red on and off button .\nB : and ll , there is .\nA : it it doesn't have to be red .\nA : these colours are really what our young people are looking for .\nA : so it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be full colour cover with such an image or or thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our market group , .\nD : or black and yellow .\nA : black and yellow , .\nC : but i'm afraid it's not possible to print picture on the device .\nC : because agree it would be to have have something like that on the device itself .\nC : but , i've read .\nB : just week ago , keyboard manufacturer would print , with and no .\nC : yes , but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its techniques .\nC : they're actually very slow in its techniques .\nA : so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .\nC : so so i'm afraid it's not possible .\nA : more more more decisions we made .\nA : yes , the voice recognition we already decided .\nB : voice recognition , .\nC : but there will be some additional buttons , .\nC : and the they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .\nA : i'm going to leave that up to you two .\nB : what what did you say ?\nC : you can use , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .\nC : so it has the spongy feel also .\nB : or you could use plastic buttons .\nB : in the rubber .\nA : because it what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy devices , or or .\nB : but then you just have the the fact that the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .\nB : what said in the in the first discussion , the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .\nA : is that does our our supplier say so ?\nB : it is not something it's no information read about it or so , but it's just from no , but but it , .\nD : didn't did we inc include the digi digits or leave them to the speech recognition ?\nD : 'cause things like volume could be placed next to the button .\nA : you could place this this would be the button .\nD : there the icons .\nA : the scroll-wheel , .\nA : and you could place the indica the signals the no no , there's no painting , only yellow or but it's into the rubber .\nD : so you don't touch the icons that much .\nB : that's possible , but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case .\nB : so still then , if you feel li if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .\nB : but but the the plus or the minus .\nC : yes , the signs .\nB : you have to draw the , it's on the cover .\nA : but this is on the pla , know .\nA : know which you understand af you mean .\nB : so if you you just move the problem .\nA : what about making this rubber and making this plastic ?\nC : see what you mean .\nC : that's possible , because our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing .\nC : so they can combine these two .\nA : actually , we should have it the other way around , .\nA : plastic cover with rubber finishing .\nA : this is this is the finishing .\nA : this is what's on the edge .\nA : what you feel .\nA : but the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber .\nA : know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?\nC : i'm i'm not so , it should be , i'm not , have to ask with manufacturing , but i'm i'm not that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber .\nB : can you separate these these do .\nC : so if you want the spongy feel , you need to make these buttons all all of rubber .\nA : never touch between the buttons .\nB : or the the sideways .\nB : or the the back .\nA : the side , exactly , the sideways .\nB : or the back .\nA : the side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ?\nB : yes , especially when there are few buttons on it , you have lot of space to touch .\nB : so you just have it in your hand completely or or you play with it .\nA : we do not have very much time left .\nA : you two have to figure that out .\nA : i'm going to leave the decision to you , because you have to make its prototype , and you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and so i'm going to leave it the decision with you .\nA : sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?\nC : what about the chips ?\nC : we use the regular chip ?\nC : and no , that's about it .\nA : with those regular chips we can still control advanced functions .\nA : the chip is is not really , .\nC : the only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced version of the chip supports .\nC : and we've decided not to use .\nA : then we are quite finished .\nA : i'll see you in thirty minutes and ?\nB : for the finishing touch .\nA : if you write wrote anything down , could you put it on the shared folder ?\nB : but sebastian has everything .\nA : know , but .\nC : i'll put it online ."], ["<t> The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. </t>  <t> It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. </t>  <t> The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. </t>  <t> The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either

the solar cell and speech recognition. </t>  <t> One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design. </t>  <t> After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). </t>  <t> The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1). </t>  <t> Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful). </t>  <t> The delay in providing costs of components was criticised. </t>  <t> The prototype will have to be redesigned, so that it is compatible with the budget constraints.. </t>  <t> The idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned, due to the escalated costs. </t>  <t> The same happened with the speech recognition. </t>  <t> In order for the cost to come down to the original budget of 12.50, they also had to replace the rubber of the buttons with plastic and not use a curved design. </t>  <t> The prototype proved extremely over budget. </t>  <t> It would cost 22 euros. </t>  <t> The team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device. </t>  <t> It was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit, although this was not what was asked in the project requirements. </t>  <t> The device cannot be a hi-tech, innovative one any more. </t> ", "B : that's the same as on the top of it with the the round button .\nC : like this one .\nB : but we don't we don't we do t's what if with ease of use , which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers .\nC : this is device which which has learning curve .\nC : novice users use this device as normal users use remote control .\nC : and after while they start to develop some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often .\nC : but other users who are new to this device need something like that .\nC : they they need to understand what how to change channels and change the volume , so it's easier for them , so .\nA : could could see the scroll bar as as as shortcut ?\nA : and the voice recognition as , you could could .\nC : yes , it's , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our .\nC : there are there are many ways of doing things on such device .\nC : it's it's quite easy .\nA : and and the case is is rubber ?\nC : yes , rubber ?\nA : and the buttons ?\nB : plastic or rubber .\nC : there are plastic or rubber .\nA : and the colouring ?\nC : yellow with grey or black like that .\nA : with with grey or black .\nC : whatever cost cost the least .\nA : we'll we'll come to that later .\nA : anything else to add or .\nC : we should think about these buttons .\nD : you could use two of them to programme the channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels .\nC : but yes , but it but these are tasks that are only executed once , .\nA : but you do want programme button to activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .\nC : li like that .\nB : and button for disabling the voice recognition .\nA : al although by pressing the button for two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with little beep and and but , that that's not really really important .\nB : that's the basic idea , .\nB : of our prototype .\nA : you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?\nD : my name is not name but , used the the documents .\nA : you are nameless .\nD : and these were the most important criteria .\nD : it should be .\nD : that's how the fashion state it .\nC : is it spongy ?\nD : fancy look and feel .\nD : so appar , but we shouldn't evaluate yet .\nB : so just walk through it step by step .\nB : is it fancy , everything believe believe it's fancy .\nC : believe it's fancy too .\nD : so , these are the most important criteria .\nA : so this these are the cr the criteria .\nA : the then we'll switch to my presentation .\nD : so that's about it .\nA : the production costs .\nA : the costs are not under can this is the , it's it's way above above the the the twelve euro fifty .\nA : and what makes it very expensive is the solar cell .\nC : t's very expensive .\nA : so we should skip that , because it's not that important .\nB : why does the price and and the , one exa .\nA : the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .\nB : the number of .\nA : this is what would call our luxury model .\nA : if you would if you look at the what we could do to make it more to make it just between the twelve euro fifty , then did the following changes .\nB : and and does it but that's that's only for the buttons .\nA : twelve euro forty cents came up with by leaving out the solar cells , by not using the voice recognition feature , because it's it's four euro addition to the price .\nA : believe , push-button , makes it the thirteen .\nA : push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .\nA : so , this design is not within our price model .\nC : but i'm afraid it's not complete .\nC : because we use spec specic special materials , the last item .\nC : and you have not added one item there .\nC : so it's way too expensive .\nA : it's still too expensive , .\nA : if we leave the if we leave this one out , .\nB : so the button we can use plastic .\nA : and not use the special form .\nB : and the pla and plastic just plastic buttons , plas instead of rubber .\nC : but it yes .\nA : it becomes very dull remote control , know .\nA : but it's the board decision .\nC : it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because there's very little added value in an enhanced case with these dull functions .\nC : so type of another market segment .\nA : we should look at an focus on another , not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy basic and maximise the profits and .\nC : that's that's better .\nC : we could we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what has been asked .\nA : know , know .\nC : so we should kick the board's .\nA : although we , but we could still make remote control that ap applies more to young people by giving it another colour already .\nA : so it is possible to make device that attracts little bit more to young people .\nA : but agree it's it's not fancy high-tech device .\nA : definitely not , no .\nA : it's not that innovative .\nA : or however you pronounce that .\nA : this is the wrong one .\nA : so that means redesign .\nA : we do not have the time now to to redesign the product .\nA : but we can evaluate the process and the satisfaction on how things went .\nA : i'm not if we need to evaluate the device first .\nD : since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway yay .\nC : it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .\nA : we we can learn .\nC : so is it fancy ?\nA : it is it is , so .\nD : is it fancy ?\nB : the yellow rubber , so .\nA : you like the rubber , roo .\nB : i'm into it .\nC : but it's not that fancy .\nA : no , i'll i'll i'll give it two .\nC : it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing .\nC : it would be even more , you really like titanium .\nA : you like tita that's flavour as .\nC : i'm i'm into it .\nC : it has flavour .\nC : you should taste it .\nA : know , but but it but that's fancy in the way fancy has has lot of .\nD : is it and , what they want wanted was colours and soft materials .\nC : it has to do with fashion , .\nB : it's trendy trendy , fun .\nD : so in that way it it's fancy .\nB : just give it two .\nC : it would have been would have think it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case .\nB : it's not the ultimate fancy two , but , but that's sti that's looking at the user needs , we only don't we don't have the double-curved case .\nC : it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use double-curved case , we could not use solar .\nB : we we do have the rubber , we do have the colours .\nB : that's two out of three .\nB : so believe we are close to two .\nC : yes , agree too .\nC : we did yes , we did good .\nD : and was it innovative ?\nA : with the voice recognition feature and no , we are evaluating this this design now .\nB : but that's not in it .\nB : ov or can we .\nC : let's let's this product .\nC : so it is .\nB : and the scroll wheel .\nB : the solar not many remotes have the solar , .\nC : it could have been little bit more innovative by using the kinetic energy source , but it's it's way too yes , but it's two .\nD : and so also two ?\nA : that would have been thrill .\nD : is it easy to use ?\nB : the voice recognition is hard to learn , .\nB : hard it's not for the for the for the elderly .\nC : but there are two parts in this remote control .\nB : they won't use it .\nC : what you see here is is the basic part .\nC : everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .\nC : that's for novice user .\nC : when you have more advanced , elaborate user , , such user really would like to explore all these additional functions .\nC : so in that in that way it is advanced , and it's easy to use for for both types of users .\nC : so it's it's not very easy for .\nB : wouldn't give it more .\nA : i'm doubting doubting as .\nD : the the most important function is easy to use .\nD : the the zapping , channel switching , volume .\nD : but the more advanced functions are probably bit harder .\nA : two or three ?\nA : wha wh what would be your ?\nA : ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions .\nA : it's the it's it's overall .\nA : is the device easy to use ?\nC : you're in that , but an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , because he is already he or she is already an advanced user .\nC : so after all , personally would give two .\nC : but so , it's two , two and three .\nA : roo , three ?\nD : i'll go for the two .\nC : so that's ten .\nA : so could make it easy ?\nB : if you make it four it will be three in general .\nC : so that's no , two and half .\nB : if he makes it four .\nC : six and four .\nC : six and four is ten .\nC : divided by four is two and half .\nB : seven , three no .\nB : four and three together .\nB : you have two , he has two .\nD : two , two , three no .\nA : no , haven't said anything yet .\nA : but if would say three , then it's six , and four is ten .\nC : divided by four .\nA : divided by four is two point five .\nB : so if you want to have the conclusion as three three .\nB : then you would make four .\nB : if you fill out four , we haven't re re really worked it out , but you you can you can just say find and he repeats find .\nC : that's not even but that's not possible to fill in , so we have to round it .\nA : but i'm filling in three .\nA : does it will so it will be two point five .\nA : yes , it is .\nA : it's not about the content , it's about , is it easy to , definitely .\nD : is it easy to find ?\nC : it it most definitely is it's very easy .\nA : or beeps or .\nB : but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker but even without it .\nC : something like that .\nA : i'm here , i'm here .\nC : you have to programme it once , so to that respond to certain word or certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing i'm here .\nC : so something like that .\nC : so , , me too .\nA : we should not stay too long on this subject because of the time , but personally give it one .\nA : the feel of the remote control is spongy .\nA : it can't be more spongy .\nA : so no , but but for the options given , it's the most spongy one .\nC : it can be .\nC : there are cases in which the outside casing is can be how how do you prono is is moldable .\nB : was it one of our options ?\nC : no , it's not one of our option , but when you look in the market , when you look yes , but that's not that's not what they are talking about , .\nD : this this was most spongy option .\nB : so , in the in .\nC : because we compare all these characteristics characteristics with market with with the real market .\nC : so there are remote controls out there which are lot more spongy .\nC : they're out there .\nA : they're out there .\nB : but in this case in this case we've done the best we could .\nC : yes , but it's not good enough , so it's two .\nA : i'll give it one .\nB : wan i'll take one .\nC : you take one ?\nC : what do you give it ?\nD : it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could but .\nA : know , but you have to name fig number .\nA : because we need to go on in for the time .\nD : if give it one there'll be one hell of calculation .\nB : it will be one .\nD : so i'll just give it two and make this one point five .\nC : no no no .\nC : i'll i'll change it , i'll make it my my mark will be four .\nA : the remote control offers enough features .\nA : ruud , what what do you think about it ?\nD : the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add lot .\nD : so , depends .\nC : it's it's completely programmable .\nC : you can add very much functionality by using the voice recognition mode .\nC : so it's quite advanced .\nA : what what we didn't talk about is it has .\nB : but it ha doesn't has the digits .\nB : believe it's if you ask yourself it offers enough features , don't don't is it has all the features normal remote has .\nD : depends on what you implement in the speech feat signal .\nA : bec because you can we didn't talk about it , but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal .\nA : so , you place regular remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it records the the the the signals .\nC : has the signals sent to it .\nA : so you could enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .\nA : so this this is remote control with very high level of features .\nA : although there are few buttons , but the inside is is quite advanced .\nC : but that that's its power , , because regular programmable remote control contains , , really lot of buttons .\nC : at at least forty buttons .\nC : so it's it's quite complicated to get to get used to .\nC : and this is quite simple .\nC : you can use your voice to to programme it .\nC : it's , i'll give it one .\nA : let's give it number .\nA : i'll give it one .\nA : for for the for this type of market , it's one .\nB : i'll give two .\nD : think one , 'cause with voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like even because it doesn't look advanced .\nC : i've we've succe succeed in in developing product that's actually quite good , but not for this market , and not for this price .\nA : so high quality , low acceptance .\nA : the product is is is high qua has high quality and and is advanced .\nA : but whether or not our clients are are willing to pay twenty five euros for this device is doub is , is not .\nA : do you agree ?\nC : yes , agree .\nA : we should have radar function .\nB : but we could couldn't what what's the selling price ?\nA : twenty five euros .\nB : and costs were twelve fifty .\nB : but even now , if only our production costs were exceeded the double , think .\nB : production cost was were was twenty two ?\nB : so selling price would be .\nC : about fifty euros .\nC : that's quite ex , it's not it's not very expensive for remote control that that has this functionality .\nB : that's price , but no .\nB : an original remote control of any t_v_ kind , phillips remote control , you pay , kn know from few years ago , it it it costed hundred gilders .\nC : yes , it's more than fifty euros .\nC : it's quite expensive , yes .\nA : bu but , know , but you're paying for for the brand , because there are remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .\nC : yes , but you can you yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .\nC : and it's easier to use because those remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does .\nC : so it's worth its price .\nA : you had an overall rating .\nD : but with these ratings should be about one point seven , .\nC : it's it's about one point five .\nB : four six seven eight .\nC : something like that .\nB : nine divided by six .\nA : we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation .\nA : about the project itself , not about the product .\nA : what did you think about the process , the project process ?\nA : try to translate that .\nA : any any other , roo ?\nB : the process was good .\nD : ye the prices .\nB : but we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .\nB : and and that was the the big deal .\nB : if we knew that before , we we could have made the the choice between what .\nC : actually , we had yes .\nC : we had we had too little information actually .\nC : so and the the the , looking at room for creativity , there was way too the the choice of components was way too narrow .\nC : so there was not really process of yes .\nA : so we could we we could be we could've been creative .\nA : but it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .\nC : in the first meeting we we already were very creative .\nC : we we thought of possibilities who are not possible with the the current offer of manufacturing components .\nC : so we're tempered by that , yes .\nA : any other thoughts on that ?\nB : no , no .\nA : you agree , .\nA : roo's on for his promotion .\nC : we're good team .\nA : so too , it's it's it's laboratory environment .\nA : missed it to be able to contact you in between and say , roo .\nC : tried once , but that was not allowed .\nA : so , but but si when taken in account the the situation , we performed pretty .\nA : the means , the smartboard , the digital pen .\nA : did you like ?\nC : the digital pen was , but smartboard was really bad .\nC : it it's the response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited .\nA : because of the response or .\nB : response and it it has .\nC : it's not accurate .\nA : so it it had to be better aligned , or what's the word ?\nB : it's not accurate .\nB : the the pointing of the pen is not the place where it it writes its where it , where it draws .\nB : it's the drawing on on the on the board is from the pen .\nB : so you to take in account that your you it's too slow .\nC : it's it needs to be calibrateds .\nA : it it was calibrated just before this meeting .\nA : the one before , the third meeting .\nA : so it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , .\nA : ruud , did you use the pen lot ?\nA : it was quite handy thing , although would like to see o_c_r_ .\nB : if it has o_c_r_ , would use , but took notes for myself and and and that's it .\nB : it was necessary for me to , because if want something on the computer , type it .\nA : to digitise them .\nB : type faster than write .\nC : but it's solution for for known problem , writing down some notes , some some inf information , and then forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .\nC : because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in quite easy way .\nC : it's good product .\nC : only t's the the shape of the pen is too big .\nC : it's not quite ergonomic .\nA : what ruud , what did you think about the smartboards ?\nD : only use it to draw rabbit , so can't say much about it .\nA : you can't really decide .\nA : missed feature to easily select slide and distribute it to the laptops .\nA : that would be very easy if you could say , want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or or the other way around , that you could show but know .\nD : no , or the other way around .\nC : yes , yes .\nC : that's quite what powerpoint does .\nB : but you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder .\nA : know , but know , but we couldn't use that feature , so missed it .\nB : so it's almost .\nA : we weren't able to do that .\nA : at least the wasn't explained how to do such .\nB : and the function of of filling an an an oval or an an object .\nC : an object , yes .\nC : the drawing cap capabilities are very limited .\nB : it's not possible .\nC : and and you were when you're using windows , you're used to certain interface and certain buttons , which you can use for drawing .\nC : and lot of these buttons don't appear here .\nC : so it's not not not way .\nB : it looks like paint actually .\nA : so it it's not even as advanced as paint .\nC : it's quite limited .\nA : the project is evaluated .\nA : but , , we need to redesign the product .\nC : very good , celebration .\nC : pop pop up the champagne .\nB : it was privilege working with you .\nA : no , we are ready .\nB : to private rooms ?\nC : see some action over there .\nA : private room , roo .\nA : that sounds quite scary .\nA : no , let's find the way to .\nC : we're done , we're finished , believe .\nC : so , are there any more cycles in this process ?\nA : don't believe so .\nA : we'd get an email .\nA : for your forty minutes .\nC : but how much time did we get for this meeting ?\nC : and how much time is left ?\nA : minute or or ten .\nA : ten or five .\nA : so , we can redesign our would like to .\nC : we we we all the redesign should be .\nC : simple , dull , one-coloured box .\nD : and no added value .\nC : no , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market .\nD : so in interesting design .\nB : but you see the problem , you can't continue your your line .\nB : it's fluffy alright .\nC : what is that ?\nC : it's giraffe eating eating leaves from tree .\nA : it's blue tongue .\nA : this is new model .\nA : but blue tongue .\nC : so you're actually promoting bluetooth .\nC : or blue tongue .\nD : it it does have natural feeling .\nA : that is it's new feature next to bluetooth to disable all bluetooth devices .\nA : we're done here .\nC : let's wrap it up .\nA : gentlemen , for your cooperation .\nC : now , let's have bottle of champagne .\nB : leave it here ."], ["<t> The goal of the project is to design an original, trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV. </t>  <t> The team comprises the project manager, the marketing expert, who is looking at user needs, the user interface designer, looking at usability, and the industrial designer, working on the engineering and materials. </t>  <t> The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design. </t>  <t> The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available. </t>  <t> The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount. </t>  <t> The whole team tried out the SMARTboard, by drawing their favourite animals. </t>  <t> Afterwards, they discussed briefly their first ideas, including the use of light materials and usability concerns. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote is just going to be for TV. </t>  <t> The design should generally be intuitive without changes that would render it an unfamiliar object to customers. </t>  <t> The team will also take into account possible usability issues concerning disabled people. </t>  <t> They also agreed to choose light materials. </t>  <t> *NA* </t> ", "A : this is our first team meeting .\nA : i'll be your project manager for today , for this project .\nA : my name is mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off .\nA : that's my that's the agenda for today .\nA : we're new to each other , so i'd like to get acquainted first .\nA : so let's do that first , let's start with you , can you introduce yourself ?\nA : you're our marketing expert .\nD : my name is dirk , dirk meinfeld .\nD : will be pr project the marketing expert .\nD : and will see what the user wants and what we can do with the new produ project product .\nA : and you are user interface .\nB : nick broer , user interface designer .\nB : i'm going to look at the technical design from the user point of view .\nC : my name is xavier juergens , i'm the industrial designer , and there are three main questions that have to find an answer to today .\nC : first one is what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like .\nA : what should it look like ?\nA : let's kick it off .\nA : there we go .\nA : so , our new project is about we need design remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\nA : took this off our corporate website .\nA : it's sums up what we need to do .\nA : we're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design .\nA : that's why our product will always fit in your home .\nA : so we need to be very at very open to what's currently hot in the market .\nA : so that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want .\nA : so so we put the fashion in electronics .\nA : so that's what we need to go for .\nA : anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha three phase of design .\nA : first step will be the functional design .\nA : and that's what we're gonna do .\nA : everybody has piece of individual work and meeting afterwards , so we can share information about so i'm gonna keep this short , since we had technical problem .\nA : so skip through this .\nA : every meeting we everybody can present their their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the smartboards here .\nA : we can use regular powerpoint presentation .\nA : i'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's actually it's very easy .\nA : like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen .\nA : like you see here , i'll just take the take here .\nA : that's it , you just put it on the board .\nA : you see pen here .\nA : you go here , just like using pen .\nA : you can just draw whatever you want .\nA : it's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want .\nA : and so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .\nA : so it should be really easy .\nA : this is to take the just take new slide and back again .\nA : we're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so it will be it's very clear for everyone , suppose .\nA : so i'll take this out .\nA : we'll use that later .\nA : just just just that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like put my presentation now .\nA : i'll put the the minutes of every meeting , i'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever .\nA : so next , been here .\nA : gonna give the electronic white-board shot .\nA : so basic idea is we have blank sheet .\nA : just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal .\nA : the creative genius should go first .\nB : the creative genius ?\nA : so , draw us your favourite animal .\nB : i'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so i'm not really good at drawing animals , but the animal which .\nA : draw us technical animal .\nA : it's still erasing .\nB : else my animal will be like king-size .\nB : like dolphin , because of its its freedom .\nB : actually worked with this .\nB : it's like it's very high-tech .\nB : bit low-responsive though .\nB : prefer pen and paper .\nA : so that's what we don't want .\nA : we want high-responsive product .\nA : so it looks more like nuclear bomb .\nB : it doesn't look like nuclear bomb .\nB : this thing isn't doing what i'm what want .\nB : so , does look like nuclear bomb .\nA : let's go easy on it .\nB : i'll just finish up real soon , because i'm so it doesn't really look like dolphin , but then again , this is all new for me .\nA : anyway , it should it it's supposed to be dolphin , you like the freedom that it that it represents .\nB : like the ocean , like swimming .\nB : do that in my spare time , so that's an now we can forget this ever happened .\nA : what do you like ?\nA : our marketing expert .\nA : show us an animal .\nD : like the elephant .\nA : pick pick pick clean sheet .\nA : take clean sheet first .\nA : just press next .\nD : free , like the elephant .\nD : it's big , it's strong , so , it's little bit you have to hold it , ?\nB : it's not really that responsive , no .\nD : it's beautiful animal .\nD : you have to press it pretty hard .\nD : with smile on it , it's very important .\nA : it's cute elephant .\nD : and not to forget its tail .\nB : and you was making comments on my dolphin .\nD : will beat the dolphin .\nA : so it's just bee .\nA : so suggest you make us the elephant in the market .\nA : the big and strong player in the market .\nA : this would be good .\nA : on to the next one .\nC : you should press next .\nA : it's up there .\nC : the animal i'd like to draw is tiger .\nB : you picked hard one , didn't you ?\nD : experience with the tiger .\nC : my drawing skills are really bad , so .\nC : they are really bad , my drawing skills .\nC : i'm not how the legs should go , but these are stripes .\nC : i've picked this animal because it's very fast .\nC : it is it knows exactly what it wants .\nC : it hardly ever wastes any resources .\nA : what does it want ?\nC : it hunts for prey , but it does it always in very well-thought way .\nC : it knows exactly what it wants .\nC : it never kills an animal just for the killing , so it's very efficient .\nC : and it tries to do everything as fast as possible .\nC : and it always goes for security , in seeking hide spot and and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important .\nC : and those things we can use .\nA : yay , i'm supposed to draw the animal next .\nA : introduce to the world the amazing ant .\nA : do everything to really small , but together they're really strong .\nA : so i'm gonna give it smiley face .\nA : not where the .\nA : just put here .\nA : so i'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so that's the coolest ant ever .\nB : you've done this before , haven't you ?\nA : love to draw ants .\nA : it's my hobby .\nA : just it's very representative what we drew , .\nA : like you take just take your freedom and use trendy interface that you design for us .\nA : you're supposed to make make it different from from what other people have , and just make it little distinct .\nA : another beep to stop the meeting .\nA : finish meeting now .\nA : put this down .\nA : we have little little time extra , but just little quick discussion to to open open our work .\nA : so what do you think about the first idea is just very short .\nA : i'll start with you .\nA : what are what are your first ideas for the new product ?\nA : what the project got was just for t_v_ remote control .\nB : do are we going to introduce multi remote control ?\nB : is it just the t_v_ or do we want to in just for t_v_ remote control .\nB : was thinking about design remote control , with our motto and all .\nB : thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with .\nB : no rational changes or whatever , 'cause it revolutionary changes , yes .\nA : so very intuitive design , .\nB : we might have to consider other design aspects of our product .\nB : so that was something wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect .\nB : t_v_ is becoming central in most homes .\nB : do we want people who are disabled in any way to , , to be able to use it as ?\nA : we want suppose we want almost everyone to be using it .\nA : so , really disabled people , , might be problem , but it's little take it into consideration .\nA : we really need to cut the meeting short .\nA : you have anything you wanna share quickly ?\nC : only one thing that has to be added according to me is the the material it is made of , it should be something light .\nC : that's it speaks for itself , but some .\nA : it should be light , .\nA : let's see , where did let's skip that .\nA : this is it .\nA : skipped this sheet .\nA : what do we this quick what we're going to selling price , twenty five euros .\nA : that's for you .\nA : the production price , twelve and half euros , approximately .\nA : just go go for that .\nA : we'll reach the reach that profit .\nB : that's not that much to work with .\nA : no , it's not much to work on .\nA : i'm , skipped it .\nA : anyways , that's , this is it .\nA : do you have anything you you came up with yet ?\nA : about marketing transfer , whatever ?\nA : marketing i'm not what you what you came up with yet .\nA : you have anything to share ?\nA : or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop .\nD : no , not really yet , but i've some ideas and will say it .\nA : anyways , the the personal coach will give you the your your personal assignments and everything .\nA : so we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes .\nA : i'm we have that .\nC : good luck everyone .\nA : i'll see you back here in thirty minutes ."], ["<t> Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes. </t>  <t> They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens. </t>  <t> It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose. </t>  <t> Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes. </t>  <t> The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned. </t>  <t> On the other hand, materials should be more durable. </t>  <t> The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. </t>  <t> There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. </t>  <t> They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD. </t>  <t> The most used buttons are going to be placed on top. </t>  <t> It might be possible to use a charger for the remote. </t>  <t> The concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting. </t>  <t> The ID will present the components concept. </t>  <t> He will also check into the importance and possibility of using rechargeable batteries and a charger. </t>  <t> The UI will present the user interface concept. </t>  <t> He will also draw some ideas for the shape of the remote. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends and see into the financial issues concerning the integration of a charger. </t>  <t> The team will also examine whether they can use an LCD and/or speech recognition. </t>  <t> Finally, they will try to think of a name for their product. </t>  <t> The target group will be people below 40. </t>  <t> The remote will only be used for TV. </t>  <t> The company colours and slogan will have to be shown on the device. </t>  <t> Buttons should be made bigger, with clearly defined functions and of durable materials to avoid fading of the symbols. </t>  <t> It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it. </t>  <t> A button that sticks on the TV could be pressed to make the lost remote beep, and perhaps also light up. </t>  <t> The remote is going to be a universal one. </t>  <t> Because symbols may fade, the additional covers could include those. </t>  <t> The remote will need to be different from those available in the market in terms of shape and colour. </t>  <t> The important buttons will be on top. </t>  <t> Speech recognition and LCD screens could be added to the remote control, but they might be too expensive for this project. </t>  <t> The industrial designer wondered whether the remote should be universal or programmable. </t>  <t> Symbols on remotes fade with time. </t>  <t> It may not be technically possible for a universal remote control to create menus for various advanced settings on the TV itself. </t>  <t> Different TVs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus, making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote. </t>  <t> It is difficult to organise or limit the number of buttons in a way that makes the remote easier to use. </t>  <t> The team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons. </t>  <t> Using a charger for the remote may be too expensive. </t>  <t> Consumers claim they would pay more for a remote with LCD screen, but adding the component might be too expensive. </t>  <t> In the case where it is added, the issue would be whether to place it at the top or the bottom of the remote. </t> ", "A : for the marketing director actually , so .\nA : see , shall we ?\nA : i'm not if he's late or delayed or whatever , so i'm gonna start soon , we have now don't have much time anyway .\nB : there he is .\nA : there you are , .\nD : little bit of pl little problem with computer .\nA : we're about to start , so have seat .\nA : today , functional design phase .\nA : i'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting .\nA : that was just to get to know each other , have little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so put the minutes on the made on the on the the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there .\nA : will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there .\nA : anyways , today three presentations , from every one of you .\nA : after that got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after over this later .\nA : but wanna start with you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with .\nA : and after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so .\nA : who would like wanna go first ?\nD : , no problem .\nD : there was little problem with my computer so not the whole presentation .\nA : anyway , let's see what you have .\nD : and want to open the my no .\nA : it's still bit open .\nA : you should close it on your own notebook , .\nD : no , that's .\nD : the functional requirements , it's very important for the user , he he wants to .\nD : the the method we used it it's not not slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use , we tested it with hundred men , and we asked them to what the remote feel like and what what's important .\nA : if cut in , is it people or men ?\nA : is it people , .\nD : both women and men , .\nA : 'cause it was only men , so .\nD : the findings seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly .\nD : and , most they want to spend money for better system , for better remote control , so we can do little things with it , and they use , they use zap lot , fifty percent say they only so that's the most important things .\nB : that's pretty shocking .\nA : so we have to we have to do something about that .\nD : not all of it is it on mine on my powerpoint presentation , but the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection .\nA : just talk ahead .\nD : it's the most basic buttons that user wants to use .\nD : less important is tel teletext , they use it , but it's not very important on the scale of zero to ten they six and half and but not important is the channel selection , the the ?\nA : that's little weird .\nD : the the no no no no no , that's very important , but and not important in the audio settings , display settings and .\nB : which channel selection ?\nA : we can we can hide those under menu , .\nD : new preferences preferences .\nD : beep to find your control , was that was in the test , the the most people find it irritating when they cannot find rem their remote control , so it's bee beep to sound it and you can find it .\nA : that's like button on your t_v_ ?\nD : and another thing they want was speech recognition so they can say what they want to let's go to channel one and that's things .\nD : and they want an screen to to look it wh what's on every channel and what do want with it ?\nA : we wanna have little preview on the remote control .\nA : preview what's on the channel .\nB : is that manageable ?\nB : 'cause it sounds pretty expensive too .\nA : that sounds too it's possible , but it's expensive , but do continue .\nD : my personal preferences is button for my favourite channel , so , so zap to my quick to my favourite channel wh what so , the remote mu must see or must see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so zap to what ?\nA : you don't set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , .\nA : you want the you want it to be programmed , programmed or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ?\nA : let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel .\nD : that's what my personal preference like .\nA : so it's it it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it .\nD : no , itself .\nD : it's easier to to sell it , but it's manageable , but we will we will see .\nD : it's little bit it's the end of it .\nD : it's little bit lost it , the computer crashed , so .\nA : no problem , it's it's , that's , go ahead .\nB : so , some technical functions .\nB : have some issues which you discussed earlier .\nB : let's just start with the method .\nB : it sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the remote control do , but there are quite some issues .\nB : so the things i'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's covered .\nB : we can do that .\nB : what goes wrong at the user .\nB : gets the remote control .\nB : where is the remote control ?\nB : we've all had it once , want to watch some television , where's the remote control ?\nB : that was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , really good idea .\nA : that seems very good .\nB : these are just the issues .\nB : come to some personal experience , findings , possible solutions later .\nB : searches for the button .\nB : there are many buttons on remote control which are not clear .\nB : so either we lose those or we try to make it little bit more clear .\nB : also symbols tend to fade after while .\nB : there's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you which channel is this button , so possibly we could find something for that , yes .\nA : so have it more make it more durable actually .\nB : yes , user presses the button .\nB : usually when you have lot of buttons , buttons are small .\nB : so you press more once remote control goes kablouey like that , so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on the remote control .\nA : so the buttons should be .\nB : and possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger si so this is what had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , sound , so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but we could do little investigation to see whether some symbols are need to be replaced by others .\nA : make it make them bigger .\nA : even more durable .\nB : so what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .\nB : so that's what had in mind .\nB : this is not the final design , this is just general idea of how i'd like to see the general idea .\nA : must say that it .\nB : so that was it .\nA : that was it .\nA : that was good .\nA : so we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , so the other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget .\nB : it's really good idea .\nC : now work little with me .\nC : let's start it as it is .\nC : there are few questions that need to be answered , you already talked about it little bit .\nC : which buttons are wanted , is our remote control universal or should it be programmable .\nC : if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need something like mode that you can switch it .\nC : because then the buttons have to send out different signal then they would normally do .\nC : and how big is the remote control going to be ?\nC : i'll tell you why that's important to me .\nC : there are lot of technical parts in the remote control , so that's why also would like to say go little bit easy on the designs , heard ab you talking about beeps and about video screens , but the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .\nC : so keep in mind that everything that you keep think of , it has to to be built .\nC : so it's that's not as easy as it might look like .\nC : material study , i'm working on that for the the costs .\nC : have to check out how far go with that .\nC : normally , circuit board is made of fibreglass and the wires are made of copper .\nC : that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , we can just go on with that .\nC : then i've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production .\nC : the more we can make at once in one piece , that is cheaper .\nA : you mean integrate them all into the circuit board .\nC : exactly , so if we make circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper .\nC : so we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again .\nA : so you have .\nC : this is what look like looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing .\nC : you have the the power coming in , then you have like switch .\nC : the switch if you press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over morse code , that's how you should see it .\nC : the morse code goes to the amplifier , then the signal is sent to two light bulbs .\nC : you have infrared and an interv how to say it ?\nC : light in indication , light that that it's functioning .\nC : here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote universal , then the processor has to make up different morse code when some button is pressed .\nC : that makes it much more complex , so we really need to have look , do we want that or not .\nC : don't have any personal preferences so far , except for the materials to be used light , that they are light .\nA : that was it ?\nC : that was it .\nA : i'll get back to my thing then .\nA : back this up to the screen .\nA : so got some new information on the project specifications are changing little .\nA : like you said teletext is not not very popular anymore because the the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either , don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it .\nA : but don't should be very it should be one of the big buttons .\nA : just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever .\nA : it's not important anymore .\nA : we're targeting young people now , because our this is new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are the younger people were defined under forty .\nA : so it's that's also good with the fashion and everything , so .\nD : and they want to pay for it and with more where with more technical specifications in the .\nA : they want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy remote that they like .\nA : if they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend spend money on it .\nA : see how far we can go with it anyway , so and one thing that should be important is that the corporate colour and slogan are recognisable , which is black and yellow , but i'm not if we we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can have lot of fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste .\nA : so with that concept started thinking , so why not just steal nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your those cost hardly anything , and people could even spend extra money on buying cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see .\nA : or we can sh we can make different basic design .\nA : and sell the covers separately , .\nA : that's just little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can it appeals to really everyone .\nA : so you don't have to you don't have to make entire remote controls .\nA : we make basic one and manufacture this cover separately .\nA : so that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone .\nA : so just i'm not if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making presentation .\nA : would you like to share ?\nC : no , this is good idea .\nC : but go ahead .\nB : is it manageable ?\nD : with with an screen you can why ?\nB : is it easy ?\nA : we should lose the screen , like you said .\nC : yes , so too .\nA : it's it's huge the is huge , it consumes batteries like hell .\nA : it takes up lot of lot of power .\nB : and it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on tight budget here .\nA : it costs lot , .\nA : what we could do , what could be possible , is not an screen but with preview , but i'm not if it's even possible .\nA : little t_v_ guide .\nA : like you have little just just text only , not colour , just little text thing so you can use your remote as t_v_ guide .\nA : i'm not it's even possible , but , make it , find little compromise in that , but what did write down ?\nC : have to check that out , i'm not .\nA : the , the beep is very simple thing to imple implement , just make button on your t_v_ and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere .\nC : that must be possible .\nA : it's easy to implement , we should go for that .\nC : i'm , whe where do you wanna hit the t_ you wanna we want button on the television .\nB : and it's just slap-on sticker with button which sends out small signal .\nA : thin , where else should you put it ?\nC : in , but that rules out universal remote control .\nC : because that's not possible .\nA : but how are you gonna use that if your if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ?\nA : you mean as like separate thing you can attach to your t_v_ .\nA : that could be possible .\nA : little little box you can attach to your t_v_ is fine then , .\nC : then i'd i'd like to know now if we want the universal remote control or not , because that's determines everything i'm gonna do .\nA : we should go for universal , because we're separate company making separate remote controls to sell to lot of diverse people .\nA : universal remote control should be possible .\nD : everyone wants to buy it , so we .\nC : then go for that .\nA : we're targeting everyone , so remote , universal is good .\nC : no , it's fine with me , but then to look for .\nA : speech recognition , it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries .\nA : so implementing speech recognition is such small apparatus , it's very hard to do .\nD : or when you say one two it it's enough , ?\nB : and it's besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that is problem in implementing this .\nA : but don't see arabian people speaking one , two whatever .\nA : it's not mature technology , it takes lot of memory and everything in in remote control , so don't should be implemented in remote control yet .\nB : it's good idea , but it's just not don't think the market's ripe for that yet .\nA : what else do we have ?\nA : you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .\nA : so the the the symbols won't fade , little harder plastic or especially li we don't we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are the popular buttons , so those always fade first .\nC : already noted that .\nA : the thing is the most important things that we have now .\nC : if we make remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make cover for every language area .\nC : that's fo is especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language .\nA : we're not we're not targeting older people , we should remember that .\nA : everything we target is under forty , so .\nA : you assume that that they read correctly and they're the most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , so no , .\nD : but but every .\nB : but should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the that's problem with the with the text then .\nA : no , it's just something you you put over them , because we , you ca , tha that's not that's not bad that's not even it's not even bad idea .\nA : , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could , if your buttons are faded , after if you make durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy new cover .\nA : i'm not it's it's hard to make .\nC : but know that the buttons are like nokia telephone on one sleeve , so you don't have to change your whole cover .\nA : so it's good and bad idea .\nC : we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .\nC : it works the same as nokia telephone , it's it's in my .\nA : know , it's just just one one piece of rubber , .\nA : that's what something have to look into .\nA : either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , i'm not which which is easier , so anyway , , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we let's see we so you have to come up with components concept , .\nA : want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to this phase , because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with .\nA : user interface is fairly obvious .\nA : it should be very intuitive , , it should speak for itself .\nA : bought remote control last week with new t_v_ , it was it it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and i'm total t_v_ new , anyway .\nA : so it should be have less or very little buttons and second second level menu for the advanced things .\nA : or just stick under menu , like you said the the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick under one menu and give it just put it in in in software piece , you can menu and you can select everything you want to to set on your t_v_ .\nB : is it techni technically possible to send signal to television and then pops up menu , because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ?\nA : that is true .\nA : no , that's true .\nC : no , don't .\nC : because the television needs to respond to the signal , and if it doesn't know how , it's exactly , that's not possible .\nB : it's an in-built menu , isn't it ?\nB : so we or we could use double-sided for less used functions you , with the cover .\nA : i'm not if it's impossible , but there's chance it's not , so .\nA : double-sided remote control ?\nA : don't think that's useful .\nB : it's an idea to overcome these issues , because no , but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used .\nA : but then you're gonna have lot of wasted buttons .\nA : you have sony t_v_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have for sony that won't for philips t_v_ .\nB : because if we use universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , so .\nA : don't think we should , for exam i'm not , for ex you have to make it little decision between the part if you want universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their t_v_s , not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with either old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of t_v_s .\nC : but that might be broken .\nA : there's there is standard between because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands .\nA : especially the big ones , the big brands , so .\nA : 'cause everybody have universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so i'm not , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible .\nA : just and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing .\nC : but there must be way to invoke the more complicated functions of television .\nC : if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it .\nC : because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our , thi so too .\nA : so we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , it's possible , just the way how to .\nA : then then you could do everything suppose , because usually the t_v_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's .\nC : and that our remote control should not look like any other .\nC : sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different .\nA : it should be little distinct from everything else , because it's either it's both mayb the shape can be little different .\nC : we should not do that .\nB : have some ideas .\nB : have some ideas .\nA : it's little more curves or whatever .\nC : that's your division .\nD : and with different colours .\nA : so , this .\nB : i'll put some on paper and present them next time the ideas that have .\nA : not what because we have forty minutes , i'm not how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so .\nB : heard beep go .\nA : but it wasn't me , it was him closing something .\nA : so anyway , , we could do some do some work now on on the design .\nA : what do you want , do you want , but , may something like this .\nB : but we like some some curves or .\nA : but though smooth inside .\nA : so you have the transmitter here .\nA : let's see that you what would be handy .\nA : that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be on their own .\nD : and light volume .\nA : let's see one , two damn it .\nB : we get the general ideas , yes .\nA : another one here .\nA : let's see what this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here .\nB : and since you're holding it like this , suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume .\nA : t's like this .\nA : withi within the , just take it .\nB : so you have the up channel the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ?\nA : do you take triangles or it should be it we should make bigger or whatever .\nD : it's it's fine , .\nB : this is what people are accustomed to , so , but this is just general idea .\nB : the menu button can go in the middle .\nA : in the middle .\nA : it's it's usually there , but .\nC : perhaps we should also make something like flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf .\nC : they they won't hear the the beep .\nA : but if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash .\nB : you won't be able to find it .\nA : and flash takes up lot of batteries again .\nC : it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost .\nD : just and l_e_d_ on it .\nB : we could make combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up .\nA : about for deaf people , so .\nA : we could do that .\nD : just light on it or very important .\nB : so we have the basic channels we've got here , the power button somewhere over here ?\nA : that thing should be central .\nA : you shouldn't be you shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere .\nD : that's it's and but you and you are reading from the you always read from the top to the the bottom of it .\nB : usually press it on top .\nB : at least that's what i'm accustomed to .\nC : have another idea , i'm not if it's possible .\nA : like that's gonna work .\nB : what would you like to ?\nA : we should move the buttons down and put it here to from top to bottom .\nA : that's true , you should the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on .\nA : so power button on top .\nB : is that somewhere here ?\nA : do we hardly it should be at the bottom somewhere .\nB : is that used often ?\nB : the mute button ?\nB : do people use that often ?\nA : turn the sound off .\nD : no , it's no .\nB : 'cause i'm accustomed to it over here , at least in general , but it's not that important , no .\nA : don't t's important , but it it should be you you could put it somewhere here .\nD : or or with the volume selection .\nA : no , because it , people are accustomed to that , it's can have that ?\nD : around not not at top at the around the volume selection .\nD : where exactly , but wha no .\nA : that's take this out and here see are we gonna take triangles anyway ?\nA : i'm drawing triangles , but , it's bigger lesser than thing .\nB : that's what people are accustomed to , aren't they ?\nA : so anyway , this is should be the channels and or sh here , .\nB : i'm accustomed to the channels being on top .\nA : should we chan , this two , channel up and down .\nC : shall we also look if it's possible to make rechargeable remote ?\nC : that you don't have to buy new batteries if every , .\nA : for that is it's on one part it's it's good thing to recharge it we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries .\nD : it's more ex expensive .\nA : you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying .\nC : but that's already possible .\nB : but isn't that expensive in the entire package ?\nA : i'm not i'm not it's if it's expensive , but just take look at it , because it might be very good idea .\nA : because if it's it's useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch t_v_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour .\nC : you could make device , but i'm not how that is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it you're the remote also can act as recharger .\nA : how about have idea .\nC : so then you can choose , you have every decision .\nC : you can put in normal penlites , rechargeable penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with wire .\nA : it's it's pretty good idea to have like base station that you put on the t_v_ .\nC : so but but that will cost lot .\nD : that's but which .\nA : could be flat , you could insert your remote into it .\nC : normal wire would be better .\nC : like like p_d_a_ , hand-held .\nC : you can just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don't need basic station .\nA : we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either beep or flash into the thing with little separate signal or so you could put that on t_v_ .\nC : that is possible , that's true .\nA : it could be very flat , could be very small .\nA : it's very small , i'm drawing it big now , but so you can put your remote on flat .\nA : and at the backside of remote just just just little hole you just put it down , it recharges .\nA : don't t's very expensive .\nB : but again , isn't that too expensive ?\nB : 'cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , docking station and do people actually want that ?\nA : i'm not if it costs lot , that that's what he that's that you that's what you buy yourself .\nC : i'm going to try to find that out .\nC : i'm not if there's information available on this , but .\nA : it's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible .\nD : but , they want to pay for it .\nB : to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?\nA : do they want but they want rechargeable one ?\nA : i'm not , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important .\nD : there was not el ask esque but but .\nC : these are comfort issues .\nC : so people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort .\nC : this is comfort .\nA : they want to pay for comfort , we just assu we we could either make separate station which just sends signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , and , we have to either that or make it integrated with with docking station .\nC : this is brilliant product .\nC : would buy it myself .\nA : it would be good actually .\nA : like the beep part anyway .\nA : so let's go through the covers is covers is good .\nC : like the covers .\nC : that's brilliant idea .\nB : can can we save this or .\nC : never thought hope if have information about that , i'm gonna .\nA : it's we can save this .\nA : up and saved .\nA : we even saved the ant .\nA : so what we have is you have you have to do lot of work on if it's possible for the cost .\nA : or you can find out what people are willing to pay .\nA : we are going for twenty five euros sales price , but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose little profit and attract more customers , we just have to see what it looks like .\nC : would like to make decision .\nC : what it costs and what materials that we can choose what we want in it and exactly , need it .\nA : if you have some financial information that that'd be , so .\nB : could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that work with some buttons , where to put it you seem to have information on that , i'd like to see some of it .\nC : was it not possible to send emails around the office ?\nA : no , it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible , not allowed , so .\nB : no , it's not .\nA : so that's why i'm not that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft .\nD : my computer crashed , so lost my presentation , but have the , but here have the the the homepage of our internet , and here is my here is my marketing report , you ca you can look at that and .\nA : haven't heard any complaints yet , so .\nA : the , they inc they include the new one .\nB : have your powerpoint presentation , get some inf information out of that .\nA : or just for you .\nB : where would we where would we want the teletext button ?\nA : no , didn't have that .\nB : because we decided that it's not that important .\nD : and one and wha what people want , i've have another thing .\nA : all it tells just let's make make new tick the new one .\nB : do we put it somewhere over here ?\nA : let's increase it little because , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important more or less .\nB : or this is something for the next meeting , draw out some ideas .\nB : we have decided more or less the basic structure .\nB : put the other buttons in .\nA : just play little with this , put shift little up or down and we'll see what looks best .\nC : what what did you wanna say ?\nA : or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share .\nD : what al already said is the the the remote controls are always lost , but it it's also for people , they want to learn it fast , not they want to no it's , it's easy to learn wi and and the if if another thing want to say is that we are looking at the market for the age younger than forty .\nA : so we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use lot .\nB : yes , but it should cover all the functions , so possibly , just an idea that popped in , but we could go step further , because some t_v_s have the possibility to adjust brightness , that menus .\nA : what we had function that what people do , so .\nA : people change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn t_v_ off and on , .\nA : that's the basic fu that's what you do i'm not who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very represented .\nA : that's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button .\nA : everything is you say in every t_v_ that's configured under the menu .\nB : yes , but it because we're making we need to adjust to the technology .\nC : but that's the question , is it ?\nC : because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu .\nA : but but most modern t_v_s have it in their menu .\nC : if it isn't , then we cannot reach it .\nC : isn't there possibility to do research on that , so we know that for ?\nC : if you rule out functions , then and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it .\nC : then the consumer bond says you cannot do this and that with it .\nB : no , thi , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an screen .\nC : that's bad bad com commercial for .\nA : we'll we'll see what we can come up with .\nD : on my report , didn't ish didn't show it in my presentation , because my computer crashed .\nD : they want to pay for an screen and speech recognition .\nA : the want to pay for .\nC : did they really said it like that ?\nC : those two things .\nC : do they realise how much that costs ?\nC : that's almost undoable .\nA : younger , age sixteen and forty five .\nD : but if if they so we can we can look at the possibilities for an and .\nA : that's all here , here it says , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical .\nC : no , that's that's .\nC : even if if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price .\nA : so we're not focusing on this .\nA : all the interest in features , not really the l_c_ here .\nA : would you pay for speech recognition in remote control .\nA : speech recognition is quite , just look at the possibilities then , because if it's what people want , it's supposed to be luxurious remote , it's not even that expensive .\nD : how much it will cost and it will come .\nA : or find compromise , just black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes .\nC : but really need finance information .\nB : doubt it , but , had something like this .\nA : we all do .\nC : we all do .\nA : it's something we should put into consideration .\nA : it's what people want , so .\nA : we should see if what it costs , if it's possible .\nA : we should do little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me .\nA : even if you put it even if you put different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , so .\nC : and the design , it should differ .\nC : this is philips , ?\nC : philips has this .\nA : have no clue .\nA : drew something what which would fit into your hand easily .\nB : to make it futuristic .\nC : realise if we make it small , then it needs to be little thicker , because need to put all the electronics in it .\nC : if we make it smaller , less wide , then we need to make it little thicker , because have to put all the electronics in it .\nA : but you have to just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy .\nA : we can stick it in in there , .\nA : even if in the worst case we can even could you give me the pen back ?\nB : so what , .\nA : so let's say that people would want an thing .\nA : let's take take the basic design again , what we , crap came up with .\nA : i'll just make it little bigger now .\nA : so transmitter here .\nA : we could let's say we have an screen , people want an screen .\nA : so then we should probably put it here .\nA : it doesn't have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there .\nA : t's good place , people don't no ?\nD : if you're reading from top to bottom , it's better to put it at the top .\nA : it's not that it's not the most important function , it's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top .\nD : but if you if you are going to put the on it , it's very important to use it , because it's use it but nee the function of it .\nA : how can you use an screen ?\nD : so you can use it maximum , because it's lot it costs lot .\nA : but why i'm not .\nB : now it's tucked away in your hand .\nA : if you if you press button , you can see it , ri i'm not wha i'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like .\nC : personally would prefer it on the top .\nB : i'm i'm still not convinced of the .\nA : you would prefer it .\nA : so we have three people saying it should be on top .\nA : but then you would would have to stack away your buttons somewhere else .\nD : it's expensive to build it , so you must use the maximum of it .\nA : this looks little about the l_c_d_s thing .\nA : it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , because it's it's .\nC : they want it .\nC : we should just try to make that if it's possible .\nC : if it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information .\nC : also keep in mind again , the screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , what more and that needs space .\nD : but , know .\nC : so have to look if that's possible .\nC : but if we .\nB : so can what we have to decide now is what goes on top .\nA : we have green now or we should we could draw draw something bit that has it on on on the bottom .\nB : do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he would we like to press it in the middle ?\nD : in middle of it .\nD : in the middle .\nA : in circle , like we like in this example .\nA : this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons .\nA : for up and down , ma make it circle on it , because it the channel button should be in the centre .\nB : yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's the most important function .\nD : it's the most import .\nA : channel button should be st stick together , here in this section .\nA : because it's we're not about the size anyway , just general design .\nB : that would make them quite small .\nB : so you'd put them here .\nA : you can make it as big as you want .\nA : if you take no , let's see .\nB : yes , but big remote control probably not something which people would like .\nC : if we have space issue , we can also lose one battery .\nC : it is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two .\nC : that might be an option .\nA : don't we if we even use an screen , we need to , definitely .\nC : but if we need two batteries and an screen , that means lot of space that we need .\nA : but we have to see what the si what the size is .\nC : but it has to be little bit heavier .\nA : the doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big .\nC : no , but the things behind it .\nD : finish meeting now .\nD : it's on your computer .\nA : finish meeting now .\nB : so would we like this or would we like the let's see what we have here .\nA : so either we either we have to decide what what people want .\nC : like this one more .\nA : either this one , this this could be the luxurious one .\nA : so we have channel buttons here .\nA : i'm just drawing something .\nA : this would this would look .\nA : you could have it small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here .\nD : or and what about speech recognition , , but or or an or an speech .\nA : you can just no , i'm not if we can do that , but we could put microphone in here .\nD : it's is better now .\nA : just to do research into both , what it costs and what it takes for space .\nC : i'll try to .\nA : but let's cut the meeting for now yes .\nC : one more thing i'd like to say , let's give this name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars .\nD : , , that's , that's .\nC : shall we all try to think about name ?\nB : so of name .\nA : let's think of name , .\nA : at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go .\nB : so yes , go and finish up and i'll see you at lunch .\nC : i've do we save the ?"], ["<t> The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. </t>  <t> The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus. </t>  <t> There are buttons for teletext, favourite channel, mute and OK. </t>  <t> It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition. </t>  <t> The prototype proved over budget (17 euros). </t>  <t> The main contributing factors were the LCD and speech recognition. </t>  <t> The latter was taken out, along with the special colour. </t>  <t> Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment. </t>  <t> After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). </t>  <t> The criteria used were look and feel (1), whether it is easy to find (1), whether it is easy to learn (2), use of LCD (3), speech recognition (7), trendiness (2). </t>  <t> Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time). </t>  <t> Finally, the decided to call their design Triple-R. </t>  <t> The PM is going to finish the project report. </t>  <t> The UI and ID will send him their design to include. </t>  <t> Because the prototype was over budget, the team decided to take out the speech recognition from the design. </t>  <t> They also discarded the special colour, and decided to rely on the changeable covers for an attractive look. </t>  <t> The remote control is going to be called Triple-R. </t>  <t> The production cost was 17 euros, 4.5 more than the budget. </t>  <t> It was imperative that some of the features had to be taken out. </t>  <t> There was disagreement over whether the special colour should be scrapped and the look to rely on the separate covers. </t>  <t> Other solutions, like abandoning the curve of the casing or replace the rubber with plastic were also suggested. </t>  <t> They were also not allowed to raise the budget limit. </t>  <t> The precise use of the LCD was not defined: it could be used for TV configuration, or, if possible, for displaying the TV programme and previews. </t>  <t> Although the SMARTboard was useful to draw ideas quickly , it could be improved in terms of response time. </t>  <t> Similarly, the digital pens did not allow the user to work on more than one page at a time. </t>  <t> The team were unable to communicate amongst themselves in between meetings, which hindered the flow of information. </t> ", "A : can close this ?\nB : we don't have any changes , do we ?\nA : there we go .\nA : here we are again .\nA : detailed design , come on .\nA : forgot to insert the minutes , but it's about the same thing we discussed before .\nA : could open that anyway , think .\nA : other design anyway , we took as we took we took rubber as as the material last time .\nA : we also that you're just busy with it .\nA : took the advanced chip to implement the advanced features .\nA : we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen , which is fine .\nA : we that the colour should be yellow and black .\nA : yellow in the back because it's trendy , more trendy than black anyway .\nA : so then we ca .\nA : we that we would implement both the and speech recognition , but i'll get to that in moment .\nA : 'cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway .\nA : so so , like said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have now , and it's bad .\nA : prototype presentation , first you built the prototype .\nA : so you could could present that .\nA : but let's see what be handy to do .\nA : nee no , you just go ahead and present the we'll scrap it later because what ?\nC : it's more or less the same as we had .\nB : it's what we upon , but just little bit more specified .\nA : that's hasn't changed that much , ?\nC : no much no no no , not .\nA : didn't expect anyway .\nA : you just coloured it .\nB : in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see over here .\nB : we chose different type of colour for the menu .\nA : like the menu .\nB : bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad .\nB : if you put them all black , it's not really that good contrast .\nA : and suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber .\nA : it's it's part of the rubber , suppose .\nA : that's more that's more durable anyway than printed on to .\nB : that's the be and it it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to so we have it's bit round shaped , that's what we had we chose the buttons to be teletext , button , favourite channel and the mute .\nC : that's the integration story again .\nB : so that's what we chose there .\nB : if you have anything to add , interrupt me .\nC : no , this is just description of what we see there .\nC : so speaks for itself .\nA : now it's my time to ruin everything .\nA : not ruin everything , but no , nah .\nA : finances , that's what we have here , what you drew .\nA : we have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor .\nA : the sample sensor and for speak recognition anyway .\nA : so which you see the which is de one of the most expensive parts .\nA : so , we have sin one curve , design .\nA : and we had special colour .\nA : suppose yellow is special colour .\nA : so just half euro for you have pushbuttons and an display .\nA : you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and half that we are permitted to use .\nA : so , easy .\nA : what do we scrap .\nA : had the best solution that came up with is just to take out the speech recognition .\nB : i'd say that too .\nA : because the has more support on customer side .\nA : there are ninety one percent of the people , like that .\nA : but ninety percent who favour an display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition .\nA : it's also harder to .\nB : we don't really have extra function with the speech sample , which you can't do with normal remote control , which people already do .\nB : so , i'd tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was big issue when we started designing this .\nA : so ju took that out .\nA : so and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so had to take out the special colour suppose .\nA : and , , didn't see anything else could take out .\nA : could take out the push-buttons , but we need those .\nD : pushbut special colour , .\nA : so , generally what came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and half euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black .\nA : we'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .\nA : you make it orange or whatever you want .\nA : it was big issue , but i'll just go back .\nB : so can't we just extend it to thirteen ?\nA : let's just let's see what , let's just see what we no , we we have to be under twelve and half .\nD : it the and the what .\nA : it it's not the project is no-go if we go over twelve and half , so .\nC : but there's another problem .\nC : but there's another problem .\nC : if we take another cover , black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work .\nA : you that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how both those work together .\nA : so , it's it's one of the it's good way to to help people to make to keep the product trendy too .\nA : just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we before .\nA : and everything that's left is is the basic function that that we want our product to have .\nA : because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip .\nA : but we need that for the display .\nA : then again , we have the display , which is also expensive .\nA : but those go together .\nA : and , we could take out the curve .\nC : or say let's lose rubber , take plastic .\nB : we could take out curve .\nA : could we could take out the curve .\nA : is that an option ?\nC : although we are demolishing little bit the style .\nD : but the and .\nB : the colour is more important than the really the curve , because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control so black and grey is .\nA : it's it it does ruin it , but the fact that took that decision or took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the the possibility of adding your own custom covers .\nD : the people spongy , .\nA : so you can change any colour you want .\nA : so it's just you deliver basic remote control with possibility to change you into whatever you want .\nC : can we then not also change the material ?\nC : we take plastic for the basic cover and we can put those to the to the other covers .\nA : you can take plastic , but it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic .\nD : and but but the people want to pay for for it , so why why do we have to keep us on the twelve and half ?\nA : so which in in turn rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break .\nC : but what do you then suggest we'd lose ?\nC : because we have to lose two things and .\nA : al like said , lost the speech recognition and lost the special colour , which would make this black black and grey .\nC : and that's enough ?\nA : that's that that that's enough , because those are the basic colours .\nB : which we can fabricate , .\nA : those are basic col they want to to ensure the profit .\nA : that that's that's the order .\nA : we're just we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this .\nD : but we can take risk .\nA : but that's not for our that's not our decision to take .\nB : no , we we need to stick to that .\nA : we have budget of twelve fifty per product .\nA : so stick that .\nA : don't t's really bad either .\nA : if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing to have they would do .\nD : hope the people will like it , but .\nA : they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was idea , because you could have all designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want .\nA : so it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the the boundaries of the your your budget .\nC : perhaps we should make .\nD : the first sheet .\nC : perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost .\nC : and that's they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that .\nC : perhaps they decide tha .\nA : is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer ?\nB : but they don't and if we so which curve is that ba that's that curve .\nA : like , it like , we don't care we don't care that you had to true , but we did we didn't get that .\nC : perhaps they no , but perhaps they think , the cover is such idea , let's that that then they thow us to make some more costs .\nC : we ca we we can at least tell them that you that .\nA : so it's it should either be pack , we sh that should be sold in in the in stores with with standard cover .\nC : no , i'm not talking about that cost but the one that has given us the order to design this .\nA : but they could , but it's an option , but , it's true .\nC : we could at least make it like this , like you said , and then tell them , we had to drop this and that , just that .\nC : it is an still an option , but not for this price .\nA : so actually it's not that much of an increase , but .\nA : we cannot contact them .\nA : it's just the order that we got .\nC : exactly , but .\nA : so that's what we gotta go with .\nA : so it's either one just to get it just to get it through final , it's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , or turn it yellow .\nA : so it's something we have to decide on .\nC : i'd say lose the curve and the colour and .\nA : say lose the curve .\nA : that's true , we could lose the , forgot that , .\nA : so that's just this one just this is the banana curve .\nA : so this would this would be straight .\nB : so we could still have the comfort .\nA : no , no , that would be curve inside the thing , .\nA : no , would ju then it would just be straight remote .\nA : just like like that .\nA : which would , , turn it into something far more ordinary .\nA : we could make it yellow then , but you second that , you second that we lose the curve .\nB : no , that it would turn out to be pretty straight-forward remote control .\nB : so that's not really that would .\nA : so it would be good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak .\nA : so we keep the curve .\nA : so the only only solution is either to use the lose the yellow or lose the rubber .\nA : and i'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .\nB : would say would agree with you on the colour , because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for little bit of more money .\nB : so we can always do that .\nA : people are willing to pay for that .\nA : so we can take that option and just with with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control .\nA : so that would still make it product .\nA : we're final on that .\nA : so it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing .\nA : but anyways we're here .\nB : which is what we discussed .\nA : this we discussed just now .\nA : that's just now just we could just discuss how the project went .\nA : was expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you , everything cannot be for free .\nD : and want to do that .\nA : we didn't it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time .\nA : because that was it was really essential really to ma because we spent entire stage designing product of which we had no idea what it would cost .\nB : yes , we could have hope it sells .\nA : so we just put something it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually .\nC : me too , felt bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning had no list of available materials , and then had not list of available finances .\nA : would have been .\nD : but let's see let's .\nA : materials would be at least the last meeting would have expected had to have that .\nA : so suppose , let's see if it sells .\nA : suppose this sells , because it's very very extended .\nA : but suppose it sells , because it's good .\nA : it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we didn't it's gonna cost anyway .\nD : let's eval evaluate the product of us , our design .\nD : have some method , requirements and scale of .\nD : will pre present some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and then we see if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .\nA : have been met , .\nD : and will make new blank sheet .\nD : so so the buttons , the look and feel .\nD : it was , but the advanced settings , screen , audio and channel we are not the menu button is it .\nB : which are accessible through the menu button .\nA : they're stuck under menu .\nA : for the menu .\nA : those are met , because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want , they have the simplicity they want .\nD : then it's all it's true .\nA : it's very very met .\nA : either two or one .\nA : we took that everything they wanted into consideration .\nA : so it could either be two or one .\nA : one and half .\nB : which is not an option .\nD : the , it's red , , but look and feel is everybo it's true .\nA : just create our own option .\nD : and the next one , when it's lost you can find it .\nA : even for deaf people , .\nA : it's don't t's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back .\nB : to make it that way , .\nA : because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light .\nA : you can hear it .\nA : but we tried , so it that's that deserves one .\nD : and it's and it's .\nD : and the next one .\nD : how is that ?\nD : we had we don't have an manual , .\nD : but that's part of it .\nC : the display could be little bit more difficult then normal remote control , but then again , it's for young people .\nD : but , an , it tells lot about .\nA : i'd use an remote control .\nC : so , exactly .\nB : and it's pretty straight-forward , you have navigation no keys to navigate through the menus .\nA : it's pretty straight-forward , .\nC : no , that's true .\nC : it won't be big problem .\nB : so one no , actu no , it it is pretty straight-forward .\nD : so it's one or .\nA : but we didn't even there was no issue on making manual actually .\nD : for the advanced settings .\nA : we didn't really discuss it , but don't takes no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , .\nD : no , that that's true .\nA : we took it it's so easy , we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really .\nD : so it takes no ti .\nA : so that's , we didn't it's either two or one , .\nC : with the more important functions on .\nA : it's two , because the is little is little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button .\nA : so might make this two instead of one , .\nD : and the , you have to see it .\nA : so just make that two .\nD : it's little bit learning .\nD : it's little bit same .\nD : but it tells you or not ?\nA : you can use the in good way .\nA : it's perfect , the where it is , what it can do , if it useful .\nD : but wha , .\nD : what are we displaying on the screen ?\nD : just only the channels and or what ?\nC : the menus things like brightness and those things we've put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those .\nB : the menu options .\nD : in the screen .\nA : no , in the screen , the small screen .\nA : what does it display ?\nD : and for channel selection , or that's not , too but .\nA : thought it was it was that people wanted previews on their i'm not if that even possible , but 'cause it's this requires quite quite bit of band-width .\nA : don't t's possible really .\nA : but the they didn't really define in what should be used for .\nD : but t_v_ guide in your .\nA : but in like t_v_ guides , that's that that you can transmit through it and everything .\nA : just for extra information on your programmes .\nD : it must be clear then what what what for we use it .\nA : but also things like like like menus or how about preferences of your with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel , how do you configure that .\nA : so that could be done by display .\nA : no , it's not one because it's we're not using it perfectly .\nA : we didn't give it don't thing over-discussing .\nA : now we gave it enough thought though .\nA : we should just lower this .\nA : it's three though .\nA : we could've used it more effectively probably .\nD : so everybody's agree with an three on it , it's .\nA : we are using it , but it's not it's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , .\nB : two or three .\nB : so you can seven .\nA : we could have ev even lost the selection button and done everything via selection .\nA : it's now it's just extra to illustrate im extra features , but .\nC : nah , it's not really only an extra .\nD : nothing , that's seven .\nA : can you talk to remote control ?\nB : or we could say it or we could say neutral , we 'cause we scratched the no , we don't have the colour .\nA : it can't talk anymore .\nA : so we scrap that .\nA : just to be prick , but you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything .\nA : but you you can talk to it .\nD : not with the speech recognition .\nD : all the trends and no colours anymore .\nD : so , only in the curves .\nA : we did take everything into consideration .\nA : the shape shape is we , that's .\nD : but the colours , we don't have special colours on it .\nA : special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi we don't have it we do have it , it's just sold as package .\nB : so yes , but the end product so we should go with two then , because it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially , but we .\nD : but we , we don't have it , so in the end product .\nC : but changing covers is also trend that we followed .\nA : it does it's not part of the basic product .\nA : it that that's what call trendy .\nA : the shape is trendy .\nA : the the sh the the functions are trendy .\nA : it's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model .\nD : now but it's not one .\nA : because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment .\nA : it's possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in different colour .\nD : it's two , ?\nD : on the last one .\nD : that that's all .\nD : it's ten , sixteen three two two point seven like that .\nA : one two three .\nA : two two point some two point something .\nB : ten , sixteen , divided by is two two third .\nA : two and two thirds .\nD : so we can say it's it's the product is it's .\nA : it's , but that's yo mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition .\nB : there's , if we make it into four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we that it's really not mplemented .\nA : 'cause , that gives you seven , which ruins your your average .\nA : without that it would be like under it wouldn't , it would be under two .\nA : so we have even with this it's reasonable .\nB : we come out on average of two one eighth .\nA : it's two is .\nB : so which is pretty good .\nA : two is pretty good .\nB : it's at least on the positive side .\nB : so we could definitely have done better if we've had more resources , but .\nA : it's probably do admit that we did miss little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the display .\nA : we could have used it more efficiently , we just didn't think of it that way .\nA : so like said , changing channels , everything hidden in your display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .\nC : but for this price , this is it's really reasonable product .\nA : we div we did very , ev even if you look at this score , we did quite .\nC : it's good product .\nD : with an screen .\nA : it just looking for improvements what what you could have improved .\nC : but if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this .\nD : you can make another one .\nA : they sh they should get kids , and just stick in t_v_ and say change the channel .\nC : but for this price you cannot ask that .\nC : you cannot think of that no , it's not .\nA : it's just not it it's not affordable .\nA : or your sh you should lose the screen probably , but that's the screen is more worth than speech recognition .\nC : it's also more attractive .\nA : that was that .\nA : so that's the final product without the speakers , .\nB : so did you .\nA : let's see , what was left in the the another one .\nA : we evaluate the product .\nA : general project , what's in , thou we were pretty creative in what we created .\nA : we took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover , which was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere .\nA : leadership is up to you .\nA : perhaps screwed up because put put speech recognition into it .\nA : but that's not for me to decide .\nA : we did pretty as team-work though .\nA : because , was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , because when got the when got the input for the financial results , initially wanted to contact you .\nD : you're working separate .\nA : say , look , this is you're doing the wrong thing , you're you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing that we cannot afford .\nA : so it would be better if if there was more communication between because that's that's what would you what you would normally do , either call or email someone .\nD : direct communication with .\nB : and we could share information which we received .\nA : so that was too bad con was impossible here anyways .\nC : that's the same thing that had in the beginning .\nC : everybody was using materials that didn't have .\nA : it didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever .\nA : there was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .\nA : so that was little unclear suppose .\nA : smartboard smartboard is pretty .\nA : especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts little it's easier to share them .\nD : my handwriting is little bit .\nB : although for actual design i'd say the response time should be little bit higher , because the digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that .\nA : it's little less it the response time is le it's very bad .\nA : it's good to visualise everything , but the response time should could be lot better .\nD : but that's , .\nB : so can you ?\nC : but there's also one problem with this noticed .\nC : you have to finish page before going to .\nA : no , you don't have to .\nA : no , you don't .\nA : jin didn't check the finish button .\nD : you can done and then it's .\nA : you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever .\nA : only if you check the notes or press done .\nA : then it then you can then it exports to word automatically .\nA : but it's not necessary to check either one of those two .\nA : you can just preview your you can just preview your page in the in the programme .\nC : but made , but made three pages and they were not finished .\nC : and when the third one was finished , wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits the pages before going further .\nA : before starting ne new page .\nA : that could be .\nC : so we cannot work on more than one page at same time .\nC : that's not possible .\nC : you have to finish it completely , then download it , it's then start new one .\nC : that's not very handy , but if that , then it's not problem .\nA : that's , it's understandable , .\nA : any new ideas ?\nA : more communication between between that's the thing noticed , that communication is very very important , because if you get new information , it's essential for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the on the design side .\nA : so that could have been better .\nA : but that's it's more of setting here that you cannot communicate than than somewhere else .\nA : so , so .\nB : could also possibly be , is it more real-time information base , so we can all see which information is available to one another .\nA : and less less spam probably .\nA : i'm not i'm not you got spammed as , but get spammed like every every two minutes there was there was another email about master classes .\nA : so which were useless actually .\nA : should probably look into them , but they were all useless .\nB : personally did not have that , but that's probably your description .\nD : after after five minutes , .\nB : but also didn't not really .\nB : but still , you had that as .\nB : is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information .\nB : there was little delay in the bit of crucial delay .\nA : didn't have any more information , it's just always the same here .\nA : so that's that's it would change , but not for me .\nA : so i'd had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually .\nA : couldn't do any research myself or see , that's , could have done little extra work probably , then but was busy enough anyway .\nA : so any new ideas found ?\nA : or is that 'cause , it's , probably is .\nB : how much time do we have for this anyway ?\nA : have no clue .\nA : that's like oh,but it should if the project is evaluated and it was it was in within budget , we should celebrate .\nA : so , think that's about it .\nC : bring out the beer .\nD : want one for my own .\nA : i'm not what we should still do though let's see wh your tasks were finished , ?\nA : what you ha from your assistant .\nC : have no more email .\nA : so let's , should sh still have the the total report to finish up .\nC : my coach is being very silent now .\nD : my personal coach what , name .\nA : we took very little time now , because , we're in agreement , everything the design is .\nA : the one thing we missed though , we don't have product name .\nC : no , we haven't think above about that .\nA : how about you cook how about you cook up product name ?\nC : it's better than thi than serial number .\nC : sony t_r_ something means nothing to me .\nD : or fruit name .\nA : just , think of catchy name .\nC : like fruit names .\nA : i'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps .\nD : fruit name like that .\nD : the banana remote .\nA : you don't want it to resemble banana .\nD : it's the form of it .\nB : the bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore .\nA : it's not yellow anyway .\nA : it's not yellow anymore .\nA : it is curved , but no , it's .\nB : was going for the r_c_ deluxe , but it's not really catchy name or anything , it's more something with our company name , can we do anything with that ?\nC : at least it's not something with numbers .\nC : numbers are so meaningless to the people .\nD : reaction , real reaction .\nB : there's something on the website which will help us out .\nB : the reaction deluxe .\nA : real reaction future r_c_ .\nA : step into the future of of remote controlling your t_v_ .\nB : is that name or campaign ?\nA : no that's that's catchy slogan .\nB : or the the real reactor .\nA : control your remote control .\nA : go for future r_c_ probably .\nA : something like it's short real reactor ?\nC : the real reactor , don't find that that bad .\nB : you should write it down as an option .\nC : because our name is real reaction .\nA : that that's that makes me think of different products than remote control really .\nA : real reaction in real real reactor .\nB : so that's one option .\nC : i'm looking for things in the name .\nC : so that the first three letters are the same .\nB : should write the banana down or ?\nA : take , take banana .\nD : banana recei r_c_ .\nC : real reaction remotes control .\nB : do you mean it like you mean it like this ?\nD : real reaction remote control .\nA : no , not like that .\nA : it should be it should be longer , because it's not product name that you print on box .\nA : just write out triple , like word triple r_c_ , triple stripe .\nA : triple dash dash c_ .\nD : the triple r_c_ , .\nC : like it like this more .\nA : triple or triple r_c_ ?\nB : like c_ now or dash in c_ ?\nA : how about do both ?\nA : if it looks stupid .\nA : that the the r_c_ together takes away the the the image of it's triple the first the first one looks like it's triple remote control , but it's only single remote control .\nD : that , this .\nA : and it's especially on the triple that's important .\nA : the real reaction remote .\nC : would lose the c_ and just name it triple .\nB : is it triple r_c_s ?\nC : it sounds like thinking about two different things and combining it .\nC : would just say triple r_s triple that's also short , catchy .\nA : triple , you can , triple .\nB : that's another option .\nB : so which ones are we going to scratch definitely ?\nB : say this one as .\nA : we're all in agreement about the triple .\nB : triple it is .\nA : and it looks when you print it in font , looks pretty .\nC : did you do now ?\nA : just like this just and you just print triple , it looks doesn't look bad , it's short , it's .\nA : so have to write my report now , .\nA : so we have everything .\nA : we have the product , we have the costs , we have the possibility of everything .\nD : it can't work .\nD : that will not .\nA : retire to my lair and finish the report .\nA : that was short meeting .\nA : but efficient though .\nC : the boss is always the last one to go home .\nC : so see you in minute .\nD : will write that one in word document .\nA : could you draw me picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ?\nC : can't we take this one ?\nD : sh , , will ask you when need the information .\nC : otherwise we have to do it all over again .\nB : don't really know whether we can save it as picture or no .\nC : is it if try ?\nC : is that with you ?\nC : i'll put it back in minute .\nC : it has been saving something , but where to .\nC : can say exp yes , .\nC : export as j_ peg .\nC : can not put this wherever wants .\nC : my document is the wrong one , .\nD : ma it's it's not on the network of the rest .\nD : that one is .\nC : document and settings .\nB : wouldn't pick that one , no .\nC : that means that we have to gonna draw it again .\nC : are you gonna do that ?\nC : yes , that's correct .\nD : can see scores ?\nD : one one , two threes , two , then we'll overall , two points .\nB : see you later ."]]
