Andy will send her a quote for the work needed by Friday .", "Andy : Hello . I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room .\nBetty : Hello Andy . Thank you for that , what are your thoughts ?\nAndy : I think it is caused by condensation , as most of the moist settles on and around the windows .\nBetty : Why is that ?\nAndy : Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water . On the windows its just water , on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow .\nBetty : So why is it all over the spare room walls , and all around the dining room ? but not in other rooms ?\nAndy : Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls .\nBetty : so why only that bedroom and not the other ones ?\nAndy : I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen .\nBetty : But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then ?\nAndy : I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it . The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees .\nBetty : Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation ?\nAndy : Not necessarily . that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house , so it would just settle somewhere else .\nBetty : So what would you recommend ?\nAndy : I would install a fan system , or PIV system , which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air . It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night .\nBetty : That sounds good . would that be sufficient ?\nAndy : If you buy a decent size it will be , but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould . That will not go away by itself .\nBetty : OK , is this something your company can help with ?\nAndy : It is indeed , we can repaint as well if you want .\nBetty : Good point . Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email ?\nAndy : Of course , I will have that done by Friday .\nBetty : That would be great .
